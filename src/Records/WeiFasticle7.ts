    "The Biographies of Lu Bu, and some related to him",
    "Lü Bu",
    "Lü Bu, courtesy name Fengxian, was a native of Jiuyuan in Wuyuan Commandery. He served in Bingzhou due to his martial prowess. When Governor Ding Yuan was appointed as Cavalry Commandant and stationed in Henei, he made Lü Bu his assistant and treated him with great favor. After Emperor Ling died, Yuan led his troops to Luoyang.",
    "[According to the \"Record of Heroes\": Yuan's courtesy name was Jianyang. He came from a humble family and was a rough person with military courage, skilled in horseback riding and archery. As an official in the southern county, he never refused difficult missions. In times of emergency, he would pursue bandits, always at the forefront. He barely knew how to read and write, and had little administrative ability.]",
    "Yuan plotted with He Jin to eliminate the palace eunuchs and was appointed as the Captain of the Imperial Guards. After He Jin's downfall, Dong Zhuo entered the capital with plans to cause chaos, intending to kill Yuan and incorporate his troops. Dong Zhuo, knowing that Yuan trusted Lü Bu, enticed Bu to kill Yuan. Lü Bu beheaded Yuan and presented his head to Dong Zhuo, who then appointed Lü Bu as Cavalry Commandant, greatly favored and trusted him, and swore to treat him as a son.",
    "Lü Bu was skilled with bow and horse, with strength surpassing others, earning the title \"Flying General.\" He was gradually promoted to Gentleman of the Palace and enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting. Since Dong Zhuo often treated people disrespectfully and feared conspiracies against him, he always had Lü Bu as his bodyguard. However, Dong was hot-tempered and narrow-minded. Once when slightly displeased, he pulled out his halberd and threw it at Lü Bu. Lü Bu nimbly avoided it with his strength [The poem says: \"Without strength and courage, it becomes the foundation for chaos.\" Note: \"Quan\" means strength.] and apologized to Dong, who then calmed down. From this point, Lü Bu secretly harbored resentment. Dong Zhuo often had Lü Bu guard the inner palace. Lü Bu had an affair with one of Dong's servant girls and feared discovery, feeling uneasy.",
    "Earlier, Minister of Works Wang Yun had warmly received Lü Bu, recognizing his physical strength and courage as a fellow countryman. Later, Lü Bu visited Yun and described how Dong Zhuo had nearly killed him. At that time, Wang Yun and Assistant Shi Sunrui were secretly plotting to kill Dong Zhuo, so they asked Lü Bu to be their inside man. Lü Bu said, \"But what about our father-son relationship?\" Wang Yun replied, \"You have the surname Lü, not his flesh and blood. Now you're concerned about your own survival, so what father-son relationship are you talking about?\" Lü Bu then agreed and personally stabbed Dong Zhuo. The details are in Dong Zhuo's biography. Wang Yun appointed Lü Bu as General of Martial Valor, gave him ceremonial authority comparable to the Three Excellencies, promoted him to Marquis of Wen, and shared power with him in court. After killing Dong Zhuo, Lü Bu feared and hated the people from Liangzhou, who in turn resented him. Because of this, Li Jue and others joined forces to attack Chang'an.",
    "[According to the \"Record of Heroes\": Guo Si was positioned north of the city. Lü Bu opened the city gate and led troops toward Si, saying, \"Withdraw your troops, and let us settle this one-on-one.\" Si and Bu then fought in single combat. Bu stabbed Si with his spear, but Si's cavalry came forward to rescue him, and both sides withdrew.]",
    "Lü Bu could not resist, and Li Jue and his allies entered Chang'an. Six decades after Dong Zhuo's death, Lü Bu was also defeated. [I, Song Zhi, note that according to the \"Record of Heroes\": Various accounts state that Lü Bu killed Dong Zhuo on the 23rd day of the fourth month and fled on the 1st day of the sixth month. There was no leap month, so it was less than sixty days.] He led several hundred horsemen out through Wu Pass, intending to join Yuan Shu.",
    "Lü Bu thought that by killing Dong Zhuo, he had avenged Yuan Shu and wanted to gain his favor. However, Yuan Shu despised his disloyalty and refused to accept him. Lü Bu then went north to Yuan Shao, who had him join in attacking Zhang Yan at Changshan. Yan had over 10,000 elite troops and several thousand cavalry. Lü Bu had an excellent horse called Red Hare. [According to \"Biography of Cao Man\": People at that time said, \"Among men there is Lü Bu, among horses there is Red Hare.\"] He often charged into enemy formations with his close associates Cheng Lian and Wei Yue, eventually defeating Zhang Yan's army. When he requested more troops, his soldiers began plundering, causing Yuan Shao to become suspicious and jealous. Lü Bu sensed this and asked to leave. Yuan Shao, fearing he might become a threat, sent strong men to kill him at night, but they failed. When the plot was exposed, Lü Bu fled to Henei.",
    "[According to the \"Record of Heroes\": Lü Bu, believing he had done great service to the Yuan family, was arrogant toward Yuan Shao's generals, thinking they were appointed without proper authority and not worthy of respect. Lü Bu asked to return to Luoyang, and Yuan Shao nominally appointed him as Colonel Director of Retainers. Outwardly, Shao said he would send him away, but secretly intended to kill him. The next day when he was to depart, Yuan Shao sent thirty armored soldiers, claiming they would escort Lü Bu. Lü Bu had them wait beside his tent while he had someone play the zither inside to create the impression he was there. When Yuan's soldiers fell asleep, Lü Bu quietly left the tent without them noticing. At midnight, the soldiers woke up and frantically slashed at Lü Bu's bed and blankets, thinking they had killed him. The next day, when Yuan Shao investigated and learned that Lü Bu was still alive, he closed the city gates. Lü Bu then left.]",
    "Lü Bu joined forces with Zhang Yang. Yuan Shao ordered his men to pursue him, but they all feared Lü Bu and dared not approach him closely.",
    "[According to the \"Record of Heroes\": Yang and his subordinate generals had all received bounties from Li Jue and Guo Si to plot against Lü Bu. When Lü Bu heard of this, he said to Yang, \"I am from your hometown. If you kill me, it would diminish your reputation. It would be better to sell me to them, and you could receive high honors from Guo Si and Li Jue.\" Yang then outwardly agreed with Li Jue and Guo Si but actually protected Lü Bu. Li Jue and Guo Si were worried about this, so they issued an imperial edict appointing Lü Bu as Governor of Yingchuan.]",
    "Zhang Miao",
    "Zhang Miao, courtesy name Mengzhuo, was a native of Shouzhang in Dongping. In his youth, he was known for his chivalry, helping those in need and generously giving away his possessions without reservation, which attracted many scholars to him. Both Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were friends with Miao. He was summoned to serve in the government office and was appointed as Cavalry Commandant due to his high reputation, later promoted to Grand Administrator of Chenliu. During Dong Zhuo's rebellion, Cao Cao and Miao were the first to raise righteous troops. In the Battle of Bian River, Miao sent Wei Zi to lead troops to assist Cao Cao. After Yuan Shao became the alliance leader, he displayed arrogance, which Miao criticized directly. Shao instructed Cao Cao to kill Miao, but Cao Cao refused, rebuking Shao: 'Mengzhuo is a close friend. We should tolerate his criticisms. Now the empire is not yet settled, we should not endanger each other.' Miao learned of this and was even more grateful to Cao Cao. When Cao Cao campaigned against Tao Qian, he instructed his family: 'If I do not return, go seek refuge with Mengzhuo.' After returning, when he saw Miao, they faced each other with tears. Their friendship was this close.",
    "When Lü Bu left Yuan Shao to join Zhang Yang, he visited Miao before departing, and they held hands making an oath. When Shao heard of this, he was greatly angered. Miao feared that Cao Cao would eventually attack him on Shao's behalf, so he felt uneasy. In the first year of Xingping (194 CE), when Cao Cao again attacked Tao Qian, Miao's younger brother Chao, along with Cao's general Chen Gong and officials Xu Si and Wang Kai, plotted to rebel against Cao Cao. Gong persuaded Miao, saying: 'Today heroes rise across the land, and the empire is fragmenting. You command thousands of troops in a strategically important area. With sword in hand and a glance around, you could be a powerful leader, yet you submit to others—isn't that shameful! Now that the provincial army has gone east, their territory is empty. Lü Bu is a valiant warrior who fights without equal. If we temporarily welcome him to jointly govern Yanzhou, we can observe the situation across the empire and adapt to changing circumstances. This is an opportunity for strategic alliance.' Miao agreed. Cao Cao had initially ordered Gong to lead troops and remain stationed in Dongjun, but Gong took his forces east to welcome Lü Bu as Governor of Yanzhou, establishing their base at Puyang. The commanderies and counties all responded to them, except for Juancheng, Dong'e, and Fan, which remained loyal to Cao Cao. Cao Cao led his army back and fought against Lü Bu at Puyang. Cao Cao's forces were disadvantaged, and they remained in a stalemate for over a hundred days. At that time, there was drought, locusts, and grain shortage, with people resorting to cannibalism. Lü Bu stationed his forces east at Shanyang. Within two years, Cao Cao eventually recaptured all the cities and defeated Lü Bu at Juye. Lü Bu fled east to Liu Bei.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': When Lü Bu met Bei, he greatly respected him and said to Bei: 'You and I are both from the border regions. I saw the forces from the east rise up to eliminate Dong Zhuo. After I killed Zhuo and headed east, none of the eastern generals would shelter me—they all wanted to kill me.' He invited Bei to sit on the women's bed in his tent, had his wife bow to Bei, offered him wine and food, and called Bei his younger brother. Bei saw that Lü Bu's words were inconsistent, so outwardly he went along with it but inwardly was displeased.]",
    "Miao followed Lü Bu, while his brother Chao remained with their family at Yongqiu. Cao Cao besieged them for several months, then massacred the city, executing Chao and his family. Miao went to Yuan Shu to request reinforcements, but before help arrived, he was killed by his own soldiers.",
    "[According to the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Emperor Xian': When Yuan Shu was considering declaring himself emperor, Miao advised him: 'The Han dynasty holds the fire virtue. Though it declined, it has risen again with abundant virtue and grace, giving birth to your excellence. You occupy the central position—when inside, you enjoy the highest seats; when outside, you are the focus of all eyes. Your eminence cannot be increased by Hua and Huo, nor can your depth be compared to springs and wells. You could be called majestic and grand, without equal. Why would you abandon this to claim the imperial title? I fear that fortune will not fill your eyes, but disaster will overflow for generations. As Zhuangzi said, a sacrificial ox adorned with embroidered clothes and raised for a year to be led to the temple with ceremonial knives—at that moment, it would prefer to be a lonely calf, but cannot attain this!' According to his main biography, Miao went to see Shu but died before arriving. Yet here it says he advised against claiming the imperial title. It's unclear which account is correct.]",
    "Liu Bei went east to attack Yuan Shu, while Lü Bu seized Xiapi. Bei returned and submitted to Bu. Bu sent Bei to garrison Xiaopei. Bu proclaimed himself Inspector of Xuzhou.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': When Lü Bu first entered Xuzhou, he sent a letter to Yuan Shu. Shu replied: 'In the past, Dong Zhuo caused chaos, destroyed the royal house, and brought disaster to my household. I raised troops in the east but was unable to defeat Zhuo. You, General, executed Zhuo and sent his head, wiping away my shame and allowing me to hold my head high in this age, without shame in life or death—this is your first great merit. Previously, when Jin Yuanxiu went toward Yanzhou, he had barely reached the border when he was defeated by the rebel Cao Cao, becoming a refugee and nearly perishing. General, when you defeated Yanzhou, I could again hold my head high far and wide—this is your second merit. In all my life, I had never heard of Liu Bei in the world, but he raised troops to fight against me; relying on your divine power, General, I was able to defeat Bei—this is your third merit. You have three great merits on my behalf, and though I am not clever, I will serve you with my life. General, you have been fighting for years and suffer from grain shortage. I now send 200,000 hu of rice to meet you on the road. This is not all—I will send more by courier. As for weapons and military supplies, whatever else you lack, great or small, just command it.' Lü Bu was overjoyed at receiving this letter and proceeded to Xiapi. The 'Brief Account' states: Yuanxiu's given name was Shang, a native of Jingzhao. Shang and his fellow countrymen Wei Xiufu and Diwu Wenxiu were all famous, known as the 'Three Xius.' At the beginning of Emperor Xian's reign, Shang was appointed Governor of Yanzhou and headed east to his commandery, but Cao Cao had already taken control of Yanzhou. Shang then sought refuge with Yuan Shu in the south. When Shu usurped the imperial title, he wanted to make Shang Grand Commandant but did not dare suggest it openly. He privately sent someone to persuade him, but Shang would not bend, and Shu did not dare force him. At the beginning of Jian'an (196 CE), Shang tried to escape but was killed by Shu. Later, when Shang's coffin arrived in the capital together with that of Grand Tutor Ma Ridi, the Emperor praised Shang's loyalty and valor, sighing with admiration. He ordered all officials to offer condolences and sacrifices, and appointed Shang's son Wei as Gentleman of the Palace, but did not do the same for Ridi. According to the 'Record of Heroes': Lü Bu advanced by land and water eastward, arriving forty li west of Xiapi. Bei's General Xu Dan of Danyang secretly sent Colonel Zhang Kuang to Lü Bu at night, saying: 'Zhang Yide (Liu Bei) and Xiapi's Magistrate Cao Bao are in conflict. Yide has killed Bao, and the city is in great chaos with no one trusting each other. The Danyang troops, numbering a thousand, are stationed inside the Baicheng western gate. When they heard of your coming from the east, everyone, high and low, was overjoyed as if reborn. If you direct your troops toward the western gate, the Danyang forces will open the gate to admit you.' That night, Bu advanced and by dawn reached the city. At daybreak, the Danyang troops opened all gates to let in Bu's forces. Bu sat above the gate while his infantry and cavalry set fires, greatly defeating Yide's troops. He captured Bei's wives, children, military supplies, and the households of his officers and soldiers. On a night in the sixth month of the first year of Jian'an (196 CE), Lü Bu's general Hao Meng from Henei rebelled, leading troops into Lü Bu's residence at Xiapi. Outside the hall door, they shouted in unison, attacking the door, which held firm. Bu did not know who the rebels were; he simply grabbed his wife, with disheveled hair and exposed upper body, and escaped through a wall by the latrine, going directly to General Gao Shun's camp and forcing his way through Shun's gate. Shun asked, 'Does the General have something to hide?' Bu replied, 'I heard the voices of men from Henei.' Shun said, 'That must be Hao Meng.' Shun immediately readied his troops and entered the residence, shooting arrows at Meng's followers, who fled in disorder. By dawn, they had returned to their original camp. Meng's officer Cao Xing turned against Meng and fought him. Meng stabbed and wounded Xing, while Xing cut off one of Meng's arms. Shun beheaded Meng, had Xing carried on a bed, and brought him to Bu. Bu questioned Xing, who said, 'Meng was acting on Yuan Shu's plot. Those involved in the plot included...' Xing replied, 'Chen Gong was part of the conspiracy.' Chen Gong, who was sitting above, turned red, and everyone noticed it. But since Gong was a high-ranking general, Bu did not question him. Xing said, 'Meng often asked me about this, but I told him that Lord Lü's generals have divine protection and cannot be attacked. I didn't expect Meng would continue in his delusion.' Bu said to Xing, 'You are a brave man!' He had him well cared for. When Xing's wound healed, Bu sent him to pacify Meng's former camp and take command of his troops.]",
    "Yuan Shu sent his general Ji Ling with thirty thousand infantry and cavalry to attack Liu Bei. Bei sought help from Lü Bu. Bu's generals said to him: 'General, you have always wanted to kill Bei. Now you can use Yuan Shu to do it.' Bu replied: 'Not so. If Shu defeats Bei, he will then connect with the generals of Taishan, and I will be surrounded by Shu. I have no choice but to help Bei.' He immediately readied one thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry and rushed to aid Bei. When Ji Ling and the others heard of Bu's arrival, they all withdrew their troops and dared not attack again. Bu camped one li southwest of Pei and sent a messenger to invite Ji Ling and the others, who also invited Bu to feast together. Bu said to Ji Ling and his colleagues: 'Xuande is my brother. Since my brother is being harassed by you gentlemen, I have come to his rescue. By nature, I do not enjoy fighting, but rather resolving conflicts.' Bu ordered a guard to raise a halberd in the middle of the camp and said: 'Gentlemen, watch me shoot at the small branch of this halberd. If I hit it with one shot, you should withdraw; if I miss, you may stay and fight.' Bu raised his bow and shot, hitting the small branch exactly. All the generals were amazed and said, 'The General has divine power!' The next day they feasted together again before disbanding.",
    "Yuan Shu wanted to form an alliance with Lü Bu, so he asked for Bu's daughter for his son, which Bu agreed to. Shu sent his envoy Han Yin to inform Bu of his plan to claim the imperial title and to fetch the bride. Chen Gui, the Chancellor of Pei, feared that if Shu and Bu became related by marriage, Xuzhou and Yangzhou would unite, causing great difficulty for the state. He went to persuade Bu: 'Lord Cao has welcomed the Emperor and assists in state affairs. His power and prestige command the age, and he is about to pacify the four seas. General, you should join in his strategies and plan for the security of Taishan. If you ally with Shu through marriage, you will earn an unjust reputation throughout the empire and face grave danger.' Bu was also resentful that Shu had not accepted him initially. Although his daughter was already on the road, he had her brought back, breaking off the marriage. He arrested Han Yin and displayed his head in the Xu marketplace. Gui wanted to send his son Deng to visit Cao Cao, but Bu refused to let him go. At this time, an imperial messenger arrived, appointing Bu as General of the Left. Bu was overjoyed and immediately allowed Deng to go, also sending him with a memorial expressing gratitude.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': Earlier, when the Emperor was in Hedong, he sent a handwritten tablet summoning Bu to come and meet him. Bu's army had no supplies and could not make the journey, so he sent a messenger with a letter. The court then appointed Bu as General Who Pacifies the East and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Pingtao. The messenger lost the documents at the border of Shanyang. Cao Cao then wrote a letter personally comforting Bu, explaining how he had welcomed the Emperor and intended to pacify the empire, along with imperial edicts offering bounties for the capture of Gongsun Zan, Yuan Shu, Han Xian, Yang Feng, and others. Bu was greatly pleased and sent another letter to the Emperor saying: 'I should have welcomed Your Majesty, but I knew Cao Cao was loyal and filial and would escort you to Xu. I previously fought against Cao, but now he protects Your Majesty. As an exterior general, I wanted to follow with my troops but feared arousing suspicion, so I remain in Xuzhou, uncertain whether to advance or retreat.' He replied to Cao Cao: 'I am a guilty man who deserves execution, yet you have personally written to comfort me and greatly praised me. I also received the imperial edict offering bounties for Yuan Shu and others, and I will risk my life to achieve results.' Cao Cao then sent the Imperial Carriage Officer Wang Ze as messenger, carrying an imperial edict and the seal of General Who Pacifies the East to formally appoint Bu. Cao Cao also wrote to Bu: 'The Shanyang garrison has forwarded the great seal that you lost. Since the state has no good gold, I have taken gold from my own family to make a new seal for you. Since the state has no purple ribbon, I have taken the purple ribbon from my own belt as a token of my sincerity. Your messenger was inadequate. Yuan Shu has proclaimed himself Emperor, and though you stopped him, your messenger did not deliver the report. The court trusts you and is sending another messenger to demonstrate your loyalty.' Bu then sent Deng to present his memorial of gratitude, along with a fine ribbon in return to Cao Cao.]",
    "When Deng met Cao Cao, he revealed that Bu was brave but lacked planning, and was fickle in his loyalties, suggesting that Cao should deal with him early. Cao Cao said: 'Bu has a wolf's heart and wild ambitions. He is truly difficult to nurture for long. No one but you could fully understand his character.' He immediately promoted Gui to the rank of Middle Two Thousand Picul and appointed Deng as Grand Administrator of Guangling. Upon parting, Cao Cao held Deng's hand and said: 'I entrust the affairs of the east to you.' He instructed Deng to secretly gather local forces to serve as an internal response when needed.",
    "At first, Lü Bu had Deng request the governorship of Xuzhou from Cao Cao. When Deng returned, Bu became angry, pulled out his halberd, chopped at the table and said: 'Your father persuaded me to cooperate with Lord Cao and break off the marriage with Yuan Shu. Now I have gained nothing that I asked for, while you father and son have both been honored. I have been sold out by you! What explanation do you have for me?' Deng remained unperturbed and calmly explained: 'When I met Lord Cao, he said, \"Dealing with the General is like raising a tiger—one must keep it well-fed with meat, for if it goes hungry, it will devour people.\" But Lord Cao replied, \"It is not as you say. It is more like raising a hawk—when hungry it serves a purpose, when full it flies away.\" Those were his words.' Bu's anger then subsided.",
    "Yuan Shu was furious and allied with Han Xian, Yang Feng, and others, sending his great general Zhang Xun to attack Lü Bu. Bu said to Gui: 'The arrival of Shu's army is because of you. What should we do about it?' Gui replied: 'Xian and Feng have only temporarily joined forces with Shu. Their strategy is not well-established, and they cannot sustain their coordination. My son Deng has a plan—they are like roosters on the same perch who cannot roost together. We can separate them.' Bu followed Gui's strategy and sent someone to persuade Xian and Feng to join forces with him against Shu's army, promising them all available military resources. Xian and Feng agreed, and Xun was badly defeated.",
    "[According to the 'Nine Provinces Chronicle': Lü Bu wrote to Xian and Feng: 'You two generals brought the Emperor eastward, earning fundamental merit for the state that should be recorded in history and remembered for ten thousand generations. Now Yuan Shu has committed treason, and we should jointly punish him. Why would you join this traitor to attack me? I have the merit of killing Dong Zhuo, and like you two generals, I am a meritorious official. We can seize this opportunity to defeat Shu together and establish achievements for the empire. This chance must not be missed.' When Xian and Feng received the letter, they immediately changed their plans and joined Bu. Bu advanced his army to within a hundred paces of Xun's camp. Xian and Feng's troops launched a simultaneous attack, beheading ten commanders and causing countless casualties, with many drowning in the river. According to the 'Record of Heroes': Later, Lü Bu led Xian and Feng's two armies toward Shouchun, advancing by land and water, plundering as they went. They reached Zhongli, captured much booty, and returned. After crossing north of the Huai River, Bu left a letter for Shu saying: 'You rely on your strong army and often speak of brave generals and warriors who will devour me, but I have always restrained myself! Though I lack courage, when I stepped like a tiger into the south of the Huai, you scurried like a rat into Shouchun with no one daring to show their face. Where are your brave generals and warriors now? You enjoy making grand claims to deceive the world, but how can you deceive everyone? In ancient times, when armies met, envoys mediated between them. I was not the first to create this strategy. We are not far apart, and we can still communicate.' After Bu completed his crossing, Shu personally led five thousand infantry and cavalry to display his forces along the Huai River. Bu's cavalry all laughed loudly at them from the north bank before returning. At that time, Xiao Jian of Donghai was serving as Chancellor of Langye, governing Ju, fortifying the city, and defending himself without communicating with Bu. Bu wrote to Jian: 'The empire rose in arms originally to eliminate Dong Zhuo. I killed Zhuo and came east, hoping to gather troops to welcome the Emperor west and restore the capital at Luoyang, but the various generals turned on each other, none willing to think of the state. I am from Wuyuan, more than five thousand li from Xuzhou, located in the northwest corner of the world, and I have not come to fight over the southeastern lands. Ju and Xiapi are not far apart, and we should communicate. If you persist in making each commandery an empire and each county a kingdom! In the past, when Yue Yi attacked Qi, he conquered more than seventy cities in a single breath, with only Ju and Jimo not falling. This was because they had Tian Dan within. Though I am not Yue Yi, you are also not Tian Dan. You should take my letter and discuss it thoroughly with your wise advisors.' When Jian received the letter, he immediately sent his secretary with a respectful note and offered five fine horses. Jian was soon attacked and defeated by Zang Ba, who captured his wealth and possessions. When Bu heard of this, he personally led infantry and cavalry toward Ju. Gao Shun advised against it: 'General, you personally killed Dong Zhuo, your might shakes the barbarians, and when you sit and look around, those near and far naturally fear and submit to you. You should not lightly go on campaign yourself. If you were to suffer a setback, the damage to your reputation would not be small.' Bu did not listen. Ba feared Bu's raids, so he indeed climbed the city walls and defended himself. Bu could not take the city and withdrew to Xiapi. Later, Ba made peace with Bu.]",
    "In the third year of Jian'an (198 CE), Lü Bu rebelled again to support Yuan Shu, sending Gao Shun to attack Liu Bei at Pei and defeating him. Cao Cao dispatched Xiahou Dun to rescue Bei, but he was defeated by Shun. Cao Cao then personally campaigned against Bu and, reaching the city, sent him a letter outlining the benefits of submission and the dangers of resistance. Bu wanted to surrender, but Chen Gong and others, knowing their own grave offenses, dissuaded him.",
    "[According to the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Emperor Xian': When Cao Cao's army reached Pengcheng, Chen Gong said to Bu: 'We should attack them first—the rested attacking the weary, we cannot fail.' Bu replied: 'It's better to wait for them to attack and push them into the Si River.' When Cao's army's attack became intense, Bu told his soldiers from atop the White Gate Tower: 'Do not struggle among yourselves. I will surrender to Lord Cao.' Chen Gong said: 'The rebel Cao Cao—what kind of lord is he! If we surrender today, it would be like an egg thrown against a stone. How could we possibly survive?']",
    "Bu sent someone to request aid from Yuan Shu and personally led over a thousand cavalry into battle. Defeated, he retreated to defend the city and dared not venture out again.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': Bu sent Xu Si and Wang Kai to seek urgent help from Yuan Shu. Shu said: 'Bu refused to give me his daughter, so he deserves to be defeated. Why come tell me about it?' Si and Kai replied: 'If Your Brilliance does not rescue Bu now, it will be your own undoing! If Bu falls, Your Brilliance will also fall.' At that time, Shu had usurped the imperial title, so they addressed him as 'Your Brilliance.' Shu then readied his troops to create the impression of supporting Bu. Bu feared that Shu would not send troops because his daughter had not been sent, so he wrapped his daughter in cotton, tied her to a horse, and personally escorted her out at night to Shu. They encountered Cao's garrison troops, arrows were exchanged, and they could not pass through, so they returned to the city. Bu wanted Chen Gong and Gao Shun to defend the city while he led cavalry to cut off Cao Cao's supply lines. Bu's wife said to him: 'General, it is right for you to personally go out and cut off Lord Cao's supply routes. But Gong and Shun have never gotten along. Once you leave, they will not work together to defend the city. If something goes wrong, where will you establish yourself? Please consider carefully and do not be misled by Gong and others. I was once abandoned by you in Chang'an and only survived because Pang Shu secretly sheltered me. Now you need not worry about me.' When Bu heard his wife's words, he was distressed and unable to decide. According to the 'Wei Chronicle': Chen Gong said to Bu: 'Lord Cao has come from afar and cannot sustain his position for long. If General, you lead infantry and cavalry to establish a position outside while I defend the city with the remaining troops, then if he turns toward you, I will attack his rear; if he attacks the city, you can rescue from outside. Within ten days, his provisions will be exhausted, and we can defeat him.' Bu agreed. But his wife said: 'In the past, the Cao family treated you like their own child, yet you left them. Now, if you entrust the entire city to General Chen, who has not treated you better than Cao Cao, abandoning your wife and children to lead an isolated force far away, if something should go wrong, how could I remain your wife?' So Bu decided against the plan.]",
    "Yuan Shu was also unable to provide assistance. Although Lü Bu was brave and fierce, he lacked strategic thinking and was suspicious by nature. He could not control his faction and trusted only his generals. His generals each had different ideas and doubted one another, so they were often defeated in battle. Cao Cao besieged them for three months, and the defenders became disunited. His generals Hou Cheng, Song Xian, and Wei Xu bound Chen Gong and led their troops in surrender.",
    "[According to the 'Nine Provinces Chronicle': Earlier, Lü Bu's cavalry commander Hou Cheng had sent a servant to tend to fifteen horses, but the servant drove all the horses away toward Pei city, intending to return to Liu Bei. Cheng personally led cavalry to pursue him and recovered all the horses. The generals gathered to congratulate Cheng, who brewed five or six hu of wine and hunted more than ten pigs. Before they could drink and eat, he first brought half a pig and five dou of wine to Bu, kneeling and saying: 'Recently, thanks to the General's grace, I recovered my lost horses. The generals have come to congratulate me, and I brewed a little wine and hunted some pigs. Before we dare to drink and eat, I first present this small token of respect.' Bu became furious and said: 'I have forbidden alcohol, yet you brew wine and gather with the generals to drink and eat like brothers—are you plotting to kill me?' Cheng was greatly frightened and left, abandoning the brewed wine and returning the generals' gifts. From then on, he harbored suspicions, and when Cao Cao besieged Xiapi, Cheng led his troops in surrender.]",
    "Lü Bu and his subordinates climbed the White Gate Tower. As the encirclement tightened, he descended and surrendered. He was bound alive, and Bu said: 'The bonds are too tight. Loosen them a little.' Cao Cao replied: 'When binding a tiger, one cannot be too gentle.' Bu pleaded: 'Lord, your only concern is Lü Bu, and now I have submitted. The empire is no longer a worry. If you lead the infantry and let me lead the cavalry, conquering the world would not be difficult.' Cao Cao showed a doubtful expression. Liu Bei stepped forward and said: 'My lord, have you forgotten how Bu treated Ding Jianyang and Grand Tutor Dong?' Cao Cao nodded in agreement. Bu then pointed at Bei and said: 'This man is the most untrustworthy of all.'",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': Bu said to Cao Cao: 'I treated my generals generously, yet in this crisis, they all betrayed me.' Cao Cao replied: 'You betrayed your wife and coveted the wives of your generals—how is that generous?' Bu fell silent. According to the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Emperor Xian': Bu asked Cao Cao: 'My lord, why are you so thin?' Cao Cao replied: 'How do you know me?' Bu said: 'We met at the Wen family garden in Luoyang.' Cao Cao said: 'Yes, I had forgotten. The reason I am thin is that I regret not having won you over earlier.' Bu said: 'Duke Huan of Qi spared Shen Hook and made Guan Zhong his minister. Now if you let me exhaust my strength in your service and be your vanguard, would that not be good?' As Bu's bonds were tight, he said to Liu Bei: 'Xuande, you are a seated guest while I am a captive. Can you not say a word to ease my situation?' Cao Cao smiled and said: 'Why don't you speak to him instead of appealing to my Lord Liu?' He intended to spare Bu and ordered that the bonds be loosened. But the Chief Clerk Wang Bi rushed forward and said: 'Bu is a violent prisoner. His troops are still nearby. We cannot loosen his bonds.' Cao Cao said: 'I originally wanted to ease them, but the Chief Clerk will not allow it. What can be done?']",
    "Thereupon, Lü Bu was strangled to death. The heads of Bu, Gong, Shun, and others were displayed at Xu before they were buried.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': Gao Shun was a man of integrity with a commanding presence. He did not drink alcohol or accept gifts. He led more than seven hundred troops, known as the 'Thousand-Man Unit,' all equipped with excellent armor and weapons. Wherever they attacked, they were victorious, earning the name 'Formation-Breaking Battalion.' Shun often advised Bu, saying: 'The destruction of families and countries is not due to a lack of loyal ministers or wise advisors but because they are not heeded. General, your actions lack careful consideration. You often speak rashly, and your mistakes are countless.' Bu recognized Shun's loyalty but could not follow his advice. After Hao Meng's rebellion, Bu grew more distant from Shun. Since Wei Xu had both external and internal connections, Bu took all the troops under Shun's command and gave them to Xu. When it came time for battle, Bu had Shun command the troops that Xu had been leading, yet Shun never showed any resentment.]",
    "Chen Gong",
    "When Cao Cao captured Chen Gong, he asked Gong if he wanted to save his elderly mother and daughter. Gong replied: 'I have heard that one who rules the world with filial piety does not sever people's familial relationships, and one who extends benevolence across the four seas does not cut off people's sacrificial rites. My elderly mother is in your hands, not in mine.' Cao Cao then took care of his mother until her death and arranged his daughter's marriage.",
    "[According to Yu's 'Brief Account': Chen Gong, courtesy name Gongtai, was a native of Dongjun. He was straightforward, righteous, and robust, and in his youth he associated with famous scholars throughout the empire. When chaos spread across the land, he initially followed Cao Cao but later became suspicious and joined Lü Bu. He devised strategies for Bu, but Bu often did not follow his plans. When Xiapi fell, the soldiers captured both Bu and Gong. Cao Cao met with them and discussed their past, which is why Bu asked to be spared. Cao Cao said to Gong: 'Gongtai, you always claimed to have abundant wisdom and plans, but how have things turned out?' Gong looked at Bu and said: 'It is simply because this man did not follow my advice that we have come to this. If he had listened to me, we might not have been captured.' Cao Cao smiled and said: 'What about the current situation?' Gong replied: 'As a subject I have been disloyal, as a son I have been unfilial. Death is my lot.' Cao Cao said: 'If that is so, what about your elderly mother?' Gong said: 'I have heard that one who rules the world with filial piety does not harm other people's parents. Whether my elderly mother lives or dies depends on you, my lord.' Cao Cao asked: 'What about your wife and children?' Gong replied: 'I have heard that one who extends benevolent governance throughout the world does not cut off people's sacrificial lineages. Whether my wife and children survive also depends on you, my lord.' Cao Cao did not respond further. Gong said: 'I request to go out and be executed, to uphold military law.' He then hurried out and could not be stopped. Cao Cao wept as he sent him off, but Gong did not look back. After Gong's death, Cao Cao treated his family even better than before.]",
    "Chen Deng",
    "Chen Deng, courtesy name Yuanlong, had a prestigious reputation in Guangling. He contributed significantly to outmaneuvering Lü Bu and was promoted to General Who Subdues the Waves. He died at the age of thirty-nine. Later, when Xu Si and Liu Bei were both sitting with Liu Biao, the Governor of Jingzhou, Biao and Bei were discussing the notable figures of the empire. Si said: 'Chen Yuanlong is a man of the lakes and seas, with an undiminished arrogance.' Bei asked Biao: 'Is what Master Xu says right or wrong?' Biao replied: 'If I say it's wrong, this gentleman is speaking of a good man, and I shouldn't contradict him without cause; if I say it's right, Yuanlong's reputation weighs heavily throughout the empire.' Bei asked Si: 'You mention his arrogance—do you have any specific incident?' Si said: 'In the past, during the chaos, I passed through Xiapi and met Yuanlong. He showed no regard for the host-guest relationship and did not speak with me for a long time. He lay on the upper couch and made me lie on the lower couch.' Bei said: 'You have the reputation of a national scholar. Now with the empire in great turmoil and the emperor displaced, one would expect you to worry about the country and forget personal concerns, with the intention of saving the world. Yet you inquire about fields and houses, speaking nothing worth considering. This is what Yuanlong would avoid, so why would he speak with you? If he were petty-minded, he might have wanted to sleep on a hundred-foot tower and make you sleep on the ground—what's the concern about upper and lower couches?' Biao laughed heartily. Bei continued: 'As for Yuanlong's literary and martial abilities, courage and ambition, one would have to seek a comparison in ancient times. It's difficult to find someone comparable at a moment's notice.'",
    "[According to the 'Deeds of Previous Worthies': Deng was loyal, bright, deep-thinking, and had great vision. From a young age, he had the ambition to support the world and aid the people. He extensively read classical texts, was refined in literary arts, and thoroughly understood all ancient classics and writings. At the age of twenty-five, he was recommended as Filial and Incorrupt and appointed as the Magistrate of Dongyang, where he cared for the elderly and raised orphans, treating the people as if they were injured. At that time, there was a famine, and Governor Tao Qian recommended Deng as Agricultural Colonel. He surveyed suitable farmlands and maximized irrigation benefits, resulting in abundant harvests of rice. When sent on a mission to Xu, Cao Cao appointed Deng as Grand Administrator of Guangling, instructing him to secretly gather forces to deal with Lü Bu. In Guangling, Deng was clear in rewards and punishments, and his authority and trust spread widely. The sea bandits led by Xue Zhou, numbering more than ten thousand households, surrendered to him. Within less than a year, his achievements were realized, and the people both feared and loved him. Deng said: 'Now they can be used.' When Cao Cao arrived at Xiapi, Deng led the commandery troops as the vanguard. At that time, Deng's younger brothers were inside Xiapi city. Bu held Deng's three brothers hostage, hoping to negotiate an alliance. Deng remained firm and continued the siege. Bu's subordinate Zhang Hong, fearing future troubles, brought Deng's three brothers out at night to join Deng. After Bu was defeated, Deng was promoted to General Who Subdues the Waves for his achievements, winning the hearts of people in the Jiang and Huai regions. He then had ambitions to conquer the south of the Yangtze. Sun Ce sent troops to attack Deng at Kuangqi city. When the enemy first arrived, their banners and armor covered the water. Everyone below Deng felt that since the enemy outnumbered the commandery troops tenfold, they might not be able to resist and should withdraw to avoid the enemy, leaving an empty city. They reasoned that water people living on land could not stay long and would eventually withdraw. Deng raised his voice sternly: 'I have received the imperial mandate to guard this land. In the past, when Ma Wenyuan held this position, he was able to pacify the southern Hundred Yue and eliminate the northern barbarians. Since I cannot eliminate these villains, how can I speak of fleeing from bandits! I will give my life to repay the state and uphold righteousness to correct chaos. The Way of Heaven follows the righteous—victory must be ours.' He closed the gates for self-defense, feigning weakness and not engaging in battle. His officers and soldiers remained silent, as if no one was there. Deng climbed the city wall to observe the situation and, knowing he could strike, ordered his soldiers to prepare their weapons overnight. At dawn, he opened the south gate, led his army toward the enemy camp, and had cavalry raid from behind. The enemy was in disarray as they tried to form ranks and could not return to their ships. Deng personally beat the war drum, unleashing his troops, and the enemy was utterly defeated, abandoning their ships and fleeing in all directions. Deng pursued the victory, killing tens of thousands. The enemy, resentful of their defeat, soon raised a larger army against Deng. Deng, knowing his forces were inadequate, sent Officer Chen Jiao to seek reinforcements from Cao Cao. Deng secretly set up a military camp ten li from the city, ordering men to gather firewood and arrange it in bundles, placing them ten paces apart in rows. He ordered them all lit at night, and when the fires blazed, those on the city walls cheered as if a great army had arrived. The enemy saw the fires, panicked, and fled. Deng led his troops in pursuit, beheading ten thousand. Deng was then transferred to be Grand Administrator of Dongcheng. The officials and people of Guangling, cherishing his kindness and virtue, uprooted the entire commandery to follow him, with the elderly and weak carrying children on their backs in pursuit. Deng explained to them and told them to return, saying: 'Your Grand Administrator was in your commandery, repeatedly facing the Wu invaders, and fortunately prevailed. What worry do you have about not having a good lord?' Sun Quan then took control of the lands beyond the Yangtze. Whenever Cao Cao stood by the great river and sighed, he regretted not having followed Chen Yuanlong's plan earlier, allowing the 'boar' to grow its claws and fangs. Emperor Wen (Cao Pi) posthumously honored Deng's achievements and appointed Deng's son Xi as a Gentleman of the Palace.]",
    "Zang Hong",
    "Zang Hong, courtesy name Ziyuan, was a native of Sheyang in Guangling. His father Min served as Gentleman Attendant for the Xiongnu, and as Grand Administrator of Zhongshan and Taiyuan, earning a reputation wherever he went.",
    "[According to Xie Cheng's 'Book of Later Han': Min had administrative talent and was skilled in governance, serving as a good official for Han. He first served as Officer in Xuzhou and was then summoned to the Minister of Works' office. He was appointed as Magistrate of Lunu, and nominated by Jizhou as exceptionally talented. He was then promoted to Inspector of Yangzhou and Grand Administrator of Danyang. At that time, there was trouble at the frontier, with the Qiang and Hu peoples raiding. The Three Offices nominated talented men, and Min was transferred to be Gentleman Attendant for the Xiongnu. After achieving merit in suppressing rebels, he was summoned to be Consultant Gentleman and returned to the capital. When he met the Grand Commandant Yuan Feng, Feng asked him about the various states of the Western Regions—their territories, customs, people, and kinds. Min thoroughly described how the Western Regions originally had 36 states, then divided into 55, and later scattered into over 100 states. He verbally detailed their sizes, distances, populations, dry or humid climates, mountains, rivers, vegetation, birds, beasts, and unusual items that differed from those in the Central Plain, while drawing the terrain with his hand. Feng marveled at his talent and sighed: \"Even if Ban Gu wrote the 'Account of the Western Regions,' how could it surpass this?\" Min was transferred to be Colonel of Changshui and ended his career as Grand Administrator of Taiyuan.]",
    "Hong was imposingly built, standing out among others. He was recommended as Filial and Incorrupt and became a Gentleman. At that time, Gentlemen from three offices were selected to fill county magistrate positions; Zhao Yu of Langye became Magistrate of Ju, Liu Dai of Donglai became Magistrate of Xiaxiang, Wang Lang of Donghai became Magistrate of Ziqiu, and Hong became Magistrate of Jiqiu. At the end of Emperor Ling's reign, he abandoned his post and returned home. Grand Administrator Zhang Chao then invited Hong to be his Assessor.",
    "When Dong Zhuo killed the Emperor and endangered the state, Hong advised Chao: \"Your lordship's family has received imperial favor for generations, and your brothers hold important commanderies. Now the royal house is in danger and the traitorous ministers have not been eliminated. This is truly the time for righteous men across the empire to repay kindness and sacrifice their lives. Our commandery is still intact, and the officials and people are prosperous. If we beat the drums, we can gather 20,000 men. Using this force to eliminate the traitors to the country and take the lead for the empire would be the greatest righteousness.\" Chao agreed and went west with Hong to Chenliu to meet his elder brother Miao to plan. Miao also had similar intentions. They met at Suanzhao, and Miao said to Chao: \"I hear that as a commandery governor, you do not make your own decisions in governance but rely entirely on Zang Hong. Who is this man?\" Chao replied: \"Hong's talent, strategy, and wisdom exceed mine. I greatly value him—he is an extraordinary talent in the empire.\" Miao immediately arranged to meet Hong and after conversing, was greatly impressed. He introduced Hong to Liu Gongshan, Inspector of Yanzhou, and Kong Xu, Inspector of Yuzhou, who both became close to Hong. They set up an altar to make a covenant, and the various prefectures and commanderies yielded to each other, none daring to take the lead, all recommending Hong. Hong then ascended the altar, held the basin, drank the blood, and made this oath: \"The Han house is unfortunate, and imperial order has been lost. The traitor Dong Zhuo has seized this opportunity to commit evil, bringing disaster to the throne and cruelty to the people. We greatly fear the destruction of the state and the devastation of the empire. Therefore, Liu Dai, Inspector of Yanzhou, Kong Xu, Inspector of Yuzhou, Zhang Miao, Grand Administrator of Chenliu, Zhang Mao, Grand Administrator of Dongjun, and Zhang Chao, Grand Administrator of Guangling, have assembled righteous forces to respond to the nation's crisis. All of us who join this covenant unite our hearts and strength to fulfill our duty as subjects, willing to die and never harboring other intentions. If any betray this oath, may they fall from their positions and leave no descendants. May Heaven and Earth and the spirits of our ancestors witness this!\" Hong's words were impassioned, and tears flowed down his face. Those who heard him, even the lowliest soldiers and servants, were all moved, and everyone was inspired to dedicate themselves.",
    "[I, Chen Shou, note: At that time, this covenant involved only Liu Dai and the other four men. The 'Wei Chronicle' wrongly included Liu Biao and several others, which is historically inaccurate. Biao firmly held the Jiang and Han regions and never left his territory—how could he possibly have joined Hong on the same altar to make a covenant?]",
    "Soon, none of the armies took the initiative to advance, and when provisions were exhausted, the forces dispersed.",
    "Chao sent Hong to consult with Grand Marshal Liu Yu, but Hong encountered Gongsun Zan's rebellion. When he reached Hejian, the armies of Youzhou and Jizhou were fighting each other, and his mission could not be accomplished. However, Yuan Shao met Hong, was also impressed by him, and formed an alliance with him. When the Inspector of Qingzhou, Jiao He, died, Shao had Hong take charge of Qingzhou to pacify the people.",
    "[According to the 'Nine Provinces Chronicle': During the Chu Ping period, Jiao He was Inspector of Qingzhou. At that time, heroes were rising everywhere, and Yellow Turban bandits were rampant. He was focused on joining the alliance and entering the capital region, neglecting to protect the people. He led his army west across the Yellow River. Soon after, Lords Yuan and Cao fought at Yangcheng and were defeated. The Yellow Turbans then expanded, massacring cities and towns. He could not resist them, although his military equipment was still effective and his soldiers still numerous. But he failed to set up proper reconnaissance and was paralyzed by exaggerated reports of danger, fleeing at the sight of bandits without ever engaging them. He tried to create ice balls to sink in the river to prevent the bandits from crossing, prayed to various gods for military success, constantly consulted divinations, and kept shamans by his side. In meetings, his words seemed lofty but empty; outside, everything was in chaos, and his fate became uncertain. The province consequently fell into ruins, becoming nothing but abandoned mounds.]",
    "Hong governed the province for two years, and the bandits all fled. Shao praised his ability and transferred him to be Grand Administrator of Dongjun, governing from Dongwuyang.",
    "When Cao Cao besieged Zhang Chao at Yongqiu, Chao said: \"I rely only on Zang Hong—he will come to save me.\" Others thought that since Yuan Shao and Cao Cao were on good terms, and Hong had been appointed by Shao, he would not risk breaking this relationship and bringing calamity upon himself by coming from afar to assist. Chao said: \"Ziyuan is a righteous man of the empire who will never betray his origins. I only fear he will be prevented from reaching us in time.\" Upon hearing this, Hong indeed wept barefoot and mobilized his troops. He also requested troops from Shao to rescue Chao, but Shao refused to grant permission. Chao's entire clan was then exterminated. Because of this, Hong resented Shao and cut off all communication with him. Shao raised an army to besiege him, which lasted for years without success. Shao ordered Hong's fellow townsman Chen Lin to write to Hong, explaining the consequences of submission or resistance and reminding him of past kindness and righteousness. Hong replied:",
    "'I have longed for you during this separation, thoughts arising in both waking and sleeping. Fortunately, we are only a short distance apart, but because we follow different paths, we cannot meet. This sadness is truly heartfelt! Recently you graciously sent me a letter expressing both public and private concerns, detailing the consequences of submission or resistance. The reason I did not immediately reply is not only because my learning is shallow and my talent dull, insufficient to answer your questions, but also because you, sir, having abandoned your side chambers, have found rest with your master while your family remains in the eastern province, and I have become his enemy. Serving such a man, even if I revealed my innermost feelings and exposed my heart, being distant and guilty, sweet words would only seem suspicious. Given your difficult position, how could you care for others? Moreover, with your talent and comprehensive knowledge of the classics, how could you be ignorant of the great Way and fail to understand the remaining principles? Yet you continue to speak this way; from this, I know that your words do not come from your heart but are meant to save me from disaster. If you wish to calculate advantages and disadvantages or debate right and wrong, such arguments fill the world—stating them again would not make them clearer, and remaining silent would not diminish them. You also say it violates the principles of severing relations to wound them—this is not something I can bear to do, which is why I discarded pen and paper without answering. I had hoped you would understand my mind from afar and realize my resolve is firm and will not change. Now I receive another message from you, citing ancient and modern examples across six pages. Though I wish to remain silent, how can I? I am a petty man who originally came here on duty. When bandits seized this great province, deeply indebted and closely bound, how could I enjoy returning today to face weapons! Whenever I climb the city wall to command troops and see the banners and drums of your master, remembering the friendship of old companions, I cannot help but weep as I string my bow and nock my arrows. Why? Because I have no regrets about supporting my lord. My lord treated me beyond all measure. When I first accepted this responsibility, I thought we would complete great deeds together and honor the royal house. How could I have known the Emperor would be displeased, this province would be invaded, the commandery leader would face misfortune in his home, and Chenliu would devise military plots? With plans stagnating, I have lost the reputation for loyalty and filial piety, and by changing allegiance, I have broken the bonds of friendship. Weighing these two options—between losing the reputation for loyalty and filial piety versus breaking the bonds of friendship—the weights are vastly different, the lines between close and distant clearly drawn. Therefore I wept and severed our relationship. If my lord had shown some consideration for old friends, treating those who stayed with respect and allowing those who left to maintain their integrity, not eagerly abandoning friends or relying on executions for support, then I would have held to Ji Zha's resolve and would not be fighting today. How can I prove this? In the past, Zhang Jingming personally ascended the altar, drank blood, delivered messages, and finally convinced Han Mu to yield his seal, allowing your master to gain territory. Afterward, merely for submitting a memorial to the court and receiving a title and record, without waiting for forgiveness for his transgressions, he suffered the disaster of extermination.'",
    "[I, Chen Shou, note: According to the 'Record of Heroes': \"Yuan Shao sent Zhang Jingming, Guo Gongze, and Gao Yuancai to persuade Han Fu to yield Jizhou.\" So Jingming did contribute to Fu's yielding his position. The other matters are unclear.]",
    "'Lü Fengxian came fleeing after attacking Dong Zhuo, requested troops but did not receive them, and announced his departure—what was his crime? Yet he was attacked and nearly killed. Liu Zihuang delivered a message that was delayed, and unable to complete his mission due to fear of power and affection for relatives, he used deception to seek return—he could be said to have aspired to loyalty and filial piety without damaging the path of hegemony—yet he was immediately killed under the banner, showing no leniency.'",
    "[I, Chen Shou, note: In Gongsun Zan's memorial listing Shao's crimes, it states: \"Shao and the former Tiger Cavalry General Liu Xun first raised troops together. Xun was effective, but for a small grievance, Shao unjustly harmed Xun. This is Shao's seventh crime.\" I suspect this was Zihuang.]",
    "'Although I am not wise and inherently unable to see the beginning and end of matters or perceive the subtle to understand the obvious, I privately estimate your master's intentions. Would he really consider these three men deserving of death, with punishments fitting the crime? In reality, he wants to unify eastern Shandong, increase troops to fight enemies, and fears that soldiers might waver without incentives. Therefore, he suppresses imperial orders to uphold his own commands—those who admire righteousness receive glory, while those who await release suffer execution. This benefits your master but does not favor wandering scholars. So I learn from those before me and fight desperately in my distress. Though I am ignorant, I have heard the words of gentlemen. This is truly not my heart's desire. It is your master who has caused this. The reason I have abandoned the people of the state and am defending this city is precisely because a gentleman does not go to an enemy state. This is why I have offended your master and been attacked for so long, yet you still cite this principle as advice for me—isn't this using the same words for different purposes, which is not what a gentleman would consider appropriate in times of trouble? I have heard that righteousness does not abandon relatives, and loyalty does not oppose one's lord. Therefore, I rely on my home province as my support and uphold the commandery leader to secure the state, achieving both loyalty and filial piety in one action—how is this wrong? Yet you want me to betray my origins and destroy my family, treating my lord and your master as equals. Your master is my elder brother in age and my close friend in relationship. I told him I was leaving because our paths diverged, to maintain my loyalty to my lord and family—this can be called proper. According to what you say, Bochui should have given his life to Wu Yuan rather than weeping in the court of Qin. If you are only concerned with immediate problems, your words will deviate from principle. Or perhaps you see that the siege has not been lifted, reinforcements have not arrived, and you feel the bond of marriage and recall our past friendship, thinking it better to bend principles and preserve life than to uphold righteousness and be destroyed. In the past, Yan Ying did not lower his resolve in the face of drawn swords, and Nan Shi did not bend his brush to seek survival, so their images were displayed in portraits and their names passed down to later generations. Now I hold a strong fortress, employ the strength of soldiers and people, and have distributed three years of provisions as resources for one year. I am helping those in difficulty and supplementing deficiencies to please the empire—how could I consider building a house and plowing fields? I only fear that autumn winds will raise dust, that Bo Kui will turn his horse south, that Zhang Yang and Feiran will create difficulties with their strength, and that the northern frontier will face the emergency of falling counties, with key supporters presenting petitions to return! Your master should learn from our situation, turn his banners back, withdraw his troops, and train his army at Ye—why should he continue to display his great anger and strong might beneath my city walls? You mock me for relying on the Black Mountain bandits as my saviors, but do you not consider the alliance of the Yellow Turbans? Besides, Feiran and his kind have all received imperial orders. In the past, Emperor Gaozu took Peng Yue at Juye, and Emperor Guangwu established his foundation among the Green Forest bandits, and both eventually rose to restore the dynasty and achieve imperial success. If they can assist a lord in spreading cultural transformation, what is there to be ashamed of? Moreover, I personally received the imperial seal and am engaged in this affair. Farewell, Kong Zhang! You seek advantage beyond the borders, while Zang Hong has received his mandate from his lord and family; you entrust yourself to the alliance leader, while Zang Hong has registered his name in Chang'an. You say my body will die and my name perish, but I also laugh that in life and death you will remain unknown. How sad! We began the same but have ended differently. Exert yourself, exert yourself, for what more can be said!'",
    "When Shao saw Hong's letter, he knew there was no intention to surrender and increased his troops to attack more vigorously. Within the city, grain was exhausted, and there was no strong relief force outside. Hong judged that he could not escape and called to his officials and soldiers, saying: \"The Yuan clan is unprincipled and their ambitions are improper. Moreover, they did not rescue my commandery leader. In accordance with the great righteousness, I cannot but die. You gentlemen have no reason to share in this disaster! Before the city falls, you should take your wives and children and leave.\" The officials, soldiers, and common people all wept, saying: \"You had no previous enmity with the Yuan clan, but because of your loyalty to the commandery leader, you have brought this destruction upon yourself. How could we officials and people bear to abandon you and leave?\" At first, they dug for rats and boiled sinews and leather; later, there was nothing left to eat. The Secretary reported that there were three dou of rice in the inner kitchen and requested to make thin gruel with half of it to distribute. Hong sighed and said: \"What use is it for me to eat this alone!\" He had thin gruel made and shared it among everyone. He killed his beloved concubine to feed the officers and soldiers. The officers and soldiers all wept, none able to look up. Seven or eight thousand men and women died lying together, but none abandoned him.",
    "When the city fell, Shao captured Hong alive. Shao had always been close to Hong, so he set up curtains and screens, gathered all his generals to see Hong, and said to him: \"Zang Hong, why have you betrayed me like this! Do you submit today?\" Hong sat firmly on the ground with angry eyes and said: \"The Yuan clan has served Han for four generations with five dukes—they can be said to have received great favor. Now the royal house is weak, but you have no intention to support it. Instead, you wish to seize this opportunity and aspire to improper ambitions, killing many loyal and good men to establish your treacherous authority. I personally saw you call Zhang of Chenliu your elder brother, so my lord should also be considered your younger brother. We should have joined forces to eliminate harm to the country. Why did you bring your forces to witness the slaughter of others! I regret that my strength was inadequate and I could not raise my blade to avenge the empire. How can you speak of submission!\" Shao had originally loved Hong and intended to make him yield, planning to spare him. But seeing Hong's sharp words and knowing he would never serve him, Shao killed him.",
    "[According to Xu Zhong's 'Three Kingdoms Critique': Hong upheld the righteousness of the empire and rescued his former lord from danger. His kindness was sufficient to move people's hearts, and his righteousness was enough to inspire weak customs. However, Yuan was also his close friend who had appointed him to govern a province. Though not a ruler-subject relationship, Yuan was certainly the alliance leader. Having accepted his appointment, Hong should not have served two masters. Yuan and Cao were on good terms, jointly supporting the royal house, while Lü Bu was unprincipled and fickle, with rebellious intentions. Miao and Chao had arbitrarily appointed Bu as provincial governor—according to royal law, he was a criminal. When Cao attacked him, it was not unreasonable for the Yuan clan to withhold aid. Hong should not have sought troops from Yuan, nor should he have later made him an enemy. For Hong's sake, if his strength was insufficient, he could have fled to another state to seek assistance, or if his plans were not ready, he could have observed for an opportunity and died for Chao. Why did he insist on defending a hopeless city without adapting to circumstances, resulting in his death, the annihilation of the people, and the failure to establish achievements? This is truly lamentable!]",
    "Hong's fellow townsman Chen Rong was a scholar in his youth who admired Hong and followed him to become Deputy Magistrate of Dongjun. Before the city fell, Hong sent him out. Shao had him present when Hong was about to be executed. Rong stood up and said to Shao: \"General, you have undertaken a great endeavor, intending to eliminate tyranny for the empire, yet you first execute the loyal and righteous. How does this accord with Heaven's will! Zang Hong was raised up to be a commandery leader—how can you kill him!\" Shao was ashamed, and his attendants grabbed Rong and led him out, saying: \"You are not Zang Hong's equal—why do you speak this way?\" Rong looked back and said: \"Humaneness and righteousness have no constants—follow them and you are a gentleman, turn from them and you are a petty person. Today I would rather die on the same day as Zang Hong than live on the same day as the General!\" He too was killed. Everyone at Shao's gathering sighed, secretly saying to one another: \"How can one day see the death of two loyal and upright men!\" Earlier, Hong had sent two adjutants out to seek help from Lü Bu; when they returned, the city had already fallen, and they all charged the enemy and died.",
    "Author's Evaluation",
    "The author says: Lü Bu had the courage of a fierce tiger but lacked extraordinary strategy. He was capricious, treacherous, and viewed everything only in terms of personal gain. From ancient times until now, there has never been someone like him who did not meet destruction. In the past, Emperor Guangwu of Han was deceived by Pang Meng, and recently, Emperor Cao of Wei was also deceived by Zhang Miao. \"Understanding people is wisdom, only for the emperor is it difficult\"—how true this is! Both Chen Deng and Zang Hong possessed heroic spirit and unyielding integrity. Deng died young, his achievements unfulfilled; Hong, with weak forces against a strong enemy, could not establish his righteous ambitions. What a pity!",

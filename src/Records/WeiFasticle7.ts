    "The Biographies of Lu Bu, Zhang Miao, Chen Deng and Zang Hong",
    "Lü Bu",
    "Lü Bu, courtesy name Fengxian, was a native of Jiuyuan in Wuyuan Commandery. He served in Bingzhou due to his martial prowess. When Governor Ding Yuan was appointed as Cavalry Commandant and stationed in Henei, he made Lü Bu his assistant and treated him with great favor. After Emperor Ling died, Yuan led his troops to Luoyang.",
    "[According to the \"Record of Heroes\": Yuan's courtesy name was Jianyang. He came from a humble family and was a rough person with military courage, skilled in horseback riding and archery. As an official in the southern county, he never refused difficult missions. In times of emergency, he would pursue bandits, always at the forefront. He barely knew how to read and write, and had little administrative ability.]",
    "Yuan plotted with He Jin to eliminate the palace eunuchs and was appointed as the Captain of the Imperial Guards. After He Jin's downfall, Dong Zhuo entered the capital with plans to cause chaos, intending to kill Yuan and incorporate his troops. Dong Zhuo, knowing that Yuan trusted Lü Bu, enticed Bu to kill Yuan. Lü Bu beheaded Yuan and presented his head to Dong Zhuo, who then appointed Lü Bu as Cavalry Commandant, greatly favored and trusted him, and swore to treat him as a son.",
    "Lü Bu was skilled with bow and horse, with strength surpassing others, earning the title \"Flying General.\" He was gradually promoted to Gentleman of the Palace and enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting. Since Dong Zhuo often treated people disrespectfully and feared conspiracies against him, he always had Lü Bu as his bodyguard. However, Dong was hot-tempered and narrow-minded. Once when slightly displeased, he pulled out his halberd and threw it at Lü Bu. Lü Bu nimbly avoided it with his strength [The poem says: \"Without strength and courage, it becomes the foundation for chaos.\" Note: \"Quan\" means strength.] and apologized to Dong, who then calmed down. From this point, Lü Bu secretly harbored resentment. Dong Zhuo often had Lü Bu guard the inner palace. Lü Bu had an affair with one of Dong's servant girls and feared discovery, feeling uneasy.",
    "Earlier, Minister of Works Wang Yun had warmly received Lü Bu, recognizing his physical strength and courage as a fellow countryman. Later, Lü Bu visited Yun and described how Dong Zhuo had nearly killed him. At that time, Wang Yun and Assistant Shi Sunrui were secretly plotting to kill Dong Zhuo, so they asked Lü Bu to be their inside man. Lü Bu said, \"But what about our father-son relationship?\" Wang Yun replied, \"You have the surname Lü, not his flesh and blood. Now you're concerned about your own survival, so what father-son relationship are you talking about?\" Lü Bu then agreed and personally stabbed Dong Zhuo. The details are in Dong Zhuo's biography. Wang Yun appointed Lü Bu as General of Martial Valor, gave him ceremonial authority comparable to the Three Excellencies, promoted him to Marquis of Wen, and shared power with him in court. After killing Dong Zhuo, Lü Bu feared and hated the people from Liangzhou, who in turn resented him. Because of this, Li Jue and others joined forces to attack Chang'an.",
    "[According to the \"Record of Heroes\": Guo Si was positioned north of the city. Lü Bu opened the city gate and led troops toward Si, saying, \"Withdraw your troops, and let us settle this one-on-one.\" Si and Bu then fought in single combat. Bu stabbed Si with his spear, but Si's cavalry came forward to rescue him, and both sides withdrew.]",
    "Lü Bu could not resist, and Li Jue and his allies entered Chang'an. Six decades after Dong Zhuo's death, Lü Bu was also defeated. [I, Song Zhi, note that according to the \"Record of Heroes\": Various accounts state that Lü Bu killed Dong Zhuo on the 23rd day of the fourth month and fled on the 1st day of the sixth month. There was no leap month, so it was less than sixty days.] He led several hundred horsemen out through Wu Pass, intending to join Yuan Shu.",
    "Lü Bu thought that by killing Dong Zhuo, he had avenged Yuan Shu and wanted to gain his favor. However, Yuan Shu despised his disloyalty and refused to accept him. Lü Bu then went north to Yuan Shao, who had him join in attacking Zhang Yan at Changshan. Yan had over 10,000 elite troops and several thousand cavalry. Lü Bu had an excellent horse called Red Hare. [According to \"Biography of Cao Man\": People at that time said, \"Among men there is Lü Bu, among horses there is Red Hare.\"] He often charged into enemy formations with his close associates Cheng Lian and Wei Yue, eventually defeating Zhang Yan's army. When he requested more troops, his soldiers began plundering, causing Yuan Shao to become suspicious and jealous. Lü Bu sensed this and asked to leave. Yuan Shao, fearing he might become a threat, sent strong men to kill him at night, but they failed. When the plot was exposed, Lü Bu fled to Henei.",
    "[According to the \"Record of Heroes\": Lü Bu, believing he had done great service to the Yuan family, was arrogant toward Yuan Shao's generals, thinking they were appointed without proper authority and not worthy of respect. Lü Bu asked to return to Luoyang, and Yuan Shao nominally appointed him as Colonel Director of Retainers. Outwardly, Shao said he would send him away, but secretly intended to kill him. The next day when he was to depart, Yuan Shao sent thirty armored soldiers, claiming they would escort Lü Bu. Lü Bu had them wait beside his tent while he had someone play the zither inside to create the impression he was there. When Yuan's soldiers fell asleep, Lü Bu quietly left the tent without them noticing. At midnight, the soldiers woke up and frantically slashed at Lü Bu's bed and blankets, thinking they had killed him. The next day, when Yuan Shao investigated and learned that Lü Bu was still alive, he closed the city gates. Lü Bu then left.]",
    "Lü Bu joined forces with Zhang Yang. Yuan Shao ordered his men to pursue him, but they all feared Lü Bu and dared not approach him closely.",
    "[According to the \"Record of Heroes\": Yang and his subordinate generals had all received bounties from Li Jue and Guo Si to plot against Lü Bu. When Lü Bu heard of this, he said to Yang, \"I am from your hometown. If you kill me, it would diminish your reputation. It would be better to sell me to them, and you could receive high honors from Guo Si and Li Jue.\" Yang then outwardly agreed with Li Jue and Guo Si but actually protected Lü Bu. Li Jue and Guo Si were worried about this, so they issued an imperial edict appointing Lü Bu as Governor of Yingchuan.]",
    "Zhang Miao",
    "Zhang Miao, courtesy name Mengzhuo, was a native of Shouzhang in Dongping. In his youth, he was known for his chivalry, helping those in need and generously giving away his possessions without reservation, which attracted many scholars to him. Both Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were friends with Miao. He was summoned to serve in the government office and was appointed as Cavalry Commandant due to his high reputation, later promoted to Grand Administrator of Chenliu. During Dong Zhuo's rebellion, Cao Cao and Miao were the first to raise righteous troops. In the Battle of Bian River, Miao sent Wei Zi to lead troops to assist Cao Cao. After Yuan Shao became the alliance leader, he displayed arrogance, which Miao criticized directly. Shao instructed Cao Cao to kill Miao, but Cao Cao refused, rebuking Shao: 'Mengzhuo is a close friend. We should tolerate his criticisms. Now the empire is not yet settled, we should not endanger each other.' Miao learned of this and was even more grateful to Cao Cao. When Cao Cao campaigned against Tao Qian, he instructed his family: 'If I do not return, go seek refuge with Mengzhuo.' After returning, when he saw Miao, they faced each other with tears. Their friendship was this close.",
    "When Lü Bu left Yuan Shao to join Zhang Yang, he visited Miao before departing, and they held hands making an oath. When Shao heard of this, he was greatly angered. Miao feared that Cao Cao would eventually attack him on Shao's behalf, so he felt uneasy. In the first year of Xingping (194 CE), when Cao Cao again attacked Tao Qian, Miao's younger brother Chao, along with Cao's general Chen Gong and officials Xu Si and Wang Kai, plotted to rebel against Cao Cao. Gong persuaded Miao, saying: 'Today heroes rise across the land, and the empire is fragmenting. You command thousands of troops in a strategically important area. With sword in hand and a glance around, you could be a powerful leader, yet you submit to others—isn't that shameful! Now that the provincial army has gone east, their territory is empty. Lü Bu is a valiant warrior who fights without equal. If we temporarily welcome him to jointly govern Yanzhou, we can observe the situation across the empire and adapt to changing circumstances. This is an opportunity for strategic alliance.' Miao agreed. Cao Cao had initially ordered Gong to lead troops and remain stationed in Dongjun, but Gong took his forces east to welcome Lü Bu as Governor of Yanzhou, establishing their base at Puyang. The commanderies and counties all responded to them, except for Juancheng, Dong'e, and Fan, which remained loyal to Cao Cao. Cao Cao led his army back and fought against Lü Bu at Puyang. Cao Cao's forces were disadvantaged, and they remained in a stalemate for over a hundred days. At that time, there was drought, locusts, and grain shortage, with people resorting to cannibalism. Lü Bu stationed his forces east at Shanyang. Within two years, Cao Cao eventually recaptured all the cities and defeated Lü Bu at Juye. Lü Bu fled east to Liu Bei.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': When Lü Bu met Bei, he greatly respected him and said to Bei: 'You and I are both from the border regions. I saw the forces from the east rise up to eliminate Dong Zhuo. After I killed Zhuo and headed east, none of the eastern generals would shelter me—they all wanted to kill me.' He invited Bei to sit on the women's bed in his tent, had his wife bow to Bei, offered him wine and food, and called Bei his younger brother. Bei saw that Lü Bu's words were inconsistent, so outwardly he went along with it but inwardly was displeased.]",
    "Miao followed Lü Bu, while his brother Chao remained with their family at Yongqiu. Cao Cao besieged them for several months, then massacred the city, executing Chao and his family. Miao went to Yuan Shu to request reinforcements, but before help arrived, he was killed by his own soldiers.",
    "[According to the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Emperor Xian': When Yuan Shu was considering declaring himself emperor, Miao advised him: 'The Han dynasty holds the fire virtue. Though it declined, it has risen again with abundant virtue and grace, giving birth to your excellence. You occupy the central position—when inside, you enjoy the highest seats; when outside, you are the focus of all eyes. Your eminence cannot be increased by Hua and Huo, nor can your depth be compared to springs and wells. You could be called majestic and grand, without equal. Why would you abandon this to claim the imperial title? I fear that fortune will not fill your eyes, but disaster will overflow for generations. As Zhuangzi said, a sacrificial ox adorned with embroidered clothes and raised for a year to be led to the temple with ceremonial knives—at that moment, it would prefer to be a lonely calf, but cannot attain this!' According to his main biography, Miao went to see Shu but died before arriving. Yet here it says he advised against claiming the imperial title. It's unclear which account is correct.]",
    "Liu Bei went east to attack Yuan Shu, while Lü Bu seized Xiapi. Bei returned and submitted to Bu. Bu sent Bei to garrison Xiaopei. Bu proclaimed himself Inspector of Xuzhou.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': When Lü Bu first entered Xuzhou, he sent a letter to Yuan Shu. Shu replied: 'In the past, Dong Zhuo caused chaos, destroyed the royal house, and brought disaster to my household. I raised troops in the east but was unable to defeat Zhuo. You, General, executed Zhuo and sent his head, wiping away my shame and allowing me to hold my head high in this age, without shame in life or death—this is your first great merit. Previously, when Jin Yuanxiu went toward Yanzhou, he had barely reached the border when he was defeated by the rebel Cao Cao, becoming a refugee and nearly perishing. General, when you defeated Yanzhou, I could again hold my head high far and wide—this is your second merit. In all my life, I had never heard of Liu Bei in the world, but he raised troops to fight against me; relying on your divine power, General, I was able to defeat Bei—this is your third merit. You have three great merits on my behalf, and though I am not clever, I will serve you with my life. General, you have been fighting for years and suffer from grain shortage. I now send 200,000 hu of rice to meet you on the road. This is not all—I will send more by courier. As for weapons and military supplies, whatever else you lack, great or small, just command it.' Lü Bu was overjoyed at receiving this letter and proceeded to Xiapi. The 'Brief Account' states: Yuanxiu's given name was Shang, a native of Jingzhao. Shang and his fellow countrymen Wei Xiufu and Diwu Wenxiu were all famous, known as the 'Three Xius.' At the beginning of Emperor Xian's reign, Shang was appointed Governor of Yanzhou and headed east to his commandery, but Cao Cao had already taken control of Yanzhou. Shang then sought refuge with Yuan Shu in the south. When Shu usurped the imperial title, he wanted to make Shang Grand Commandant but did not dare suggest it openly. He privately sent someone to persuade him, but Shang would not bend, and Shu did not dare force him. At the beginning of Jian'an (196 CE), Shang tried to escape but was killed by Shu. Later, when Shang's coffin arrived in the capital together with that of Grand Tutor Ma Ridi, the Emperor praised Shang's loyalty and valor, sighing with admiration. He ordered all officials to offer condolences and sacrifices, and appointed Shang's son Wei as Gentleman of the Palace, but did not do the same for Ridi. According to the 'Record of Heroes': Lü Bu advanced by land and water eastward, arriving forty li west of Xiapi. Bei's General Xu Dan of Danyang secretly sent Colonel Zhang Kuang to Lü Bu at night, saying: 'Zhang Yide (Liu Bei) and Xiapi's Magistrate Cao Bao are in conflict. Yide has killed Bao, and the city is in great chaos with no one trusting each other. The Danyang troops, numbering a thousand, are stationed inside the Baicheng western gate. When they heard of your coming from the east, everyone, high and low, was overjoyed as if reborn. If you direct your troops toward the western gate, the Danyang forces will open the gate to admit you.' That night, Bu advanced and by dawn reached the city. At daybreak, the Danyang troops opened all gates to let in Bu's forces. Bu sat above the gate while his infantry and cavalry set fires, greatly defeating Yide's troops. He captured Bei's wives, children, military supplies, and the households of his officers and soldiers. On a night in the sixth month of the first year of Jian'an (196 CE), Lü Bu's general Hao Meng from Henei rebelled, leading troops into Lü Bu's residence at Xiapi. Outside the hall door, they shouted in unison, attacking the door, which held firm. Bu did not know who the rebels were; he simply grabbed his wife, with disheveled hair and exposed upper body, and escaped through a wall by the latrine, going directly to General Gao Shun's camp and forcing his way through Shun's gate. Shun asked, 'Does the General have something to hide?' Bu replied, 'I heard the voices of men from Henei.' Shun said, 'That must be Hao Meng.' Shun immediately readied his troops and entered the residence, shooting arrows at Meng's followers, who fled in disorder. By dawn, they had returned to their original camp. Meng's officer Cao Xing turned against Meng and fought him. Meng stabbed and wounded Xing, while Xing cut off one of Meng's arms. Shun beheaded Meng, had Xing carried on a bed, and brought him to Bu. Bu questioned Xing, who said, 'Meng was acting on Yuan Shu's plot. Those involved in the plot included...' Xing replied, 'Chen Gong was part of the conspiracy.' Chen Gong, who was sitting above, turned red, and everyone noticed it. But since Gong was a high-ranking general, Bu did not question him. Xing said, 'Meng often asked me about this, but I told him that Lord Lü's generals have divine protection and cannot be attacked. I didn't expect Meng would continue in his delusion.' Bu said to Xing, 'You are a brave man!' He had him well cared for. When Xing's wound healed, Bu sent him to pacify Meng's former camp and take command of his troops.]",
    "Yuan Shu sent his general Ji Ling with thirty thousand infantry and cavalry to attack Liu Bei. Bei sought help from Lü Bu. Bu's generals said to him: 'General, you have always wanted to kill Bei. Now you can use Yuan Shu to do it.' Bu replied: 'Not so. If Shu defeats Bei, he will then connect with the generals of Taishan, and I will be surrounded by Shu. I have no choice but to help Bei.' He immediately readied one thousand infantry and two hundred cavalry and rushed to aid Bei. When Ji Ling and the others heard of Bu's arrival, they all withdrew their troops and dared not attack again. Bu camped one li southwest of Pei and sent a messenger to invite Ji Ling and the others, who also invited Bu to feast together. Bu said to Ji Ling and his colleagues: 'Xuande is my brother. Since my brother is being harassed by you gentlemen, I have come to his rescue. By nature, I do not enjoy fighting, but rather resolving conflicts.' Bu ordered a guard to raise a halberd in the middle of the camp and said: 'Gentlemen, watch me shoot at the small branch of this halberd. If I hit it with one shot, you should withdraw; if I miss, you may stay and fight.' Bu raised his bow and shot, hitting the small branch exactly. All the generals were amazed and said, 'The General has divine power!' The next day they feasted together again before disbanding.",
    "Yuan Shu wanted to form an alliance with Lü Bu, so he asked for Bu's daughter for his son, which Bu agreed to. Shu sent his envoy Han Yin to inform Bu of his plan to claim the imperial title and to fetch the bride. Chen Gui, the Chancellor of Pei, feared that if Shu and Bu became related by marriage, Xuzhou and Yangzhou would unite, causing great difficulty for the state. He went to persuade Bu: 'Lord Cao has welcomed the Emperor and assists in state affairs. His power and prestige command the age, and he is about to pacify the four seas. General, you should join in his strategies and plan for the security of Taishan. If you ally with Shu through marriage, you will earn an unjust reputation throughout the empire and face grave danger.' Bu was also resentful that Shu had not accepted him initially. Although his daughter was already on the road, he had her brought back, breaking off the marriage. He arrested Han Yin and displayed his head in the Xu marketplace. Gui wanted to send his son Deng to visit Cao Cao, but Bu refused to let him go. At this time, an imperial messenger arrived, appointing Bu as General of the Left. Bu was overjoyed and immediately allowed Deng to go, also sending him with a memorial expressing gratitude.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': Earlier, when the Emperor was in Hedong, he sent a handwritten tablet summoning Bu to come and meet him. Bu's army had no supplies and could not make the journey, so he sent a messenger with a letter. The court then appointed Bu as General Who Pacifies the East and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Pingtao. The messenger lost the documents at the border of Shanyang. Cao Cao then wrote a letter personally comforting Bu, explaining how he had welcomed the Emperor and intended to pacify the empire, along with imperial edicts offering bounties for the capture of Gongsun Zan, Yuan Shu, Han Xian, Yang Feng, and others. Bu was greatly pleased and sent another letter to the Emperor saying: 'I should have welcomed Your Majesty, but I knew Cao Cao was loyal and filial and would escort you to Xu. I previously fought against Cao, but now he protects Your Majesty. As an exterior general, I wanted to follow with my troops but feared arousing suspicion, so I remain in Xuzhou, uncertain whether to advance or retreat.' He replied to Cao Cao: 'I am a guilty man who deserves execution, yet you have personally written to comfort me and greatly praised me. I also received the imperial edict offering bounties for Yuan Shu and others, and I will risk my life to achieve results.' Cao Cao then sent the Imperial Carriage Officer Wang Ze as messenger, carrying an imperial edict and the seal of General Who Pacifies the East to formally appoint Bu. Cao Cao also wrote to Bu: 'The Shanyang garrison has forwarded the great seal that you lost. Since the state has no good gold, I have taken gold from my own family to make a new seal for you. Since the state has no purple ribbon, I have taken the purple ribbon from my own belt as a token of my sincerity. Your messenger was inadequate. Yuan Shu has proclaimed himself Emperor, and though you stopped him, your messenger did not deliver the report. The court trusts you and is sending another messenger to demonstrate your loyalty.' Bu then sent Deng to present his memorial of gratitude, along with a fine ribbon in return to Cao Cao.]",
    "When Deng met Cao Cao, he revealed that Bu was brave but lacked planning, and was fickle in his loyalties, suggesting that Cao should deal with him early. Cao Cao said: 'Bu has a wolf's heart and wild ambitions. He is truly difficult to nurture for long. No one but you could fully understand his character.' He immediately promoted Gui to the rank of Middle Two Thousand Picul and appointed Deng as Grand Administrator of Guangling. Upon parting, Cao Cao held Deng's hand and said: 'I entrust the affairs of the east to you.' He instructed Deng to secretly gather local forces to serve as an internal response when needed.",
    "At first, Lü Bu had Deng request the governorship of Xuzhou from Cao Cao. When Deng returned, Bu became angry, pulled out his halberd, chopped at the table and said: 'Your father persuaded me to cooperate with Lord Cao and break off the marriage with Yuan Shu. Now I have gained nothing that I asked for, while you father and son have both been honored. I have been sold out by you! What explanation do you have for me?' Deng remained unperturbed and calmly explained: 'When I met Lord Cao, he said, \"Dealing with the General is like raising a tiger—one must keep it well-fed with meat, for if it goes hungry, it will devour people.\" But Lord Cao replied, \"It is not as you say. It is more like raising a hawk—when hungry it serves a purpose, when full it flies away.\" Those were his words.' Bu's anger then subsided.",
    "Yuan Shu was furious and allied with Han Xian, Yang Feng, and others, sending his great general Zhang Xun to attack Lü Bu. Bu said to Gui: 'The arrival of Shu's army is because of you. What should we do about it?' Gui replied: 'Xian and Feng have only temporarily joined forces with Shu. Their strategy is not well-established, and they cannot sustain their coordination. My son Deng has a plan—they are like roosters on the same perch who cannot roost together. We can separate them.' Bu followed Gui's strategy and sent someone to persuade Xian and Feng to join forces with him against Shu's army, promising them all available military resources. Xian and Feng agreed, and Xun was badly defeated.",
    "[According to the 'Nine Provinces Chronicle': Lü Bu wrote to Xian and Feng: 'You two generals brought the Emperor eastward, earning fundamental merit for the state that should be recorded in history and remembered for ten thousand generations. Now Yuan Shu has committed treason, and we should jointly punish him. Why would you join this traitor to attack me? I have the merit of killing Dong Zhuo, and like you two generals, I am a meritorious official. We can seize this opportunity to defeat Shu together and establish achievements for the empire. This chance must not be missed.' When Xian and Feng received the letter, they immediately changed their plans and joined Bu. Bu advanced his army to within a hundred paces of Xun's camp. Xian and Feng's troops launched a simultaneous attack, beheading ten commanders and causing countless casualties, with many drowning in the river. According to the 'Record of Heroes': Later, Lü Bu led Xian and Feng's two armies toward Shouchun, advancing by land and water, plundering as they went. They reached Zhongli, captured much booty, and returned. After crossing north of the Huai River, Bu left a letter for Shu saying: 'You rely on your strong army and often speak of brave generals and warriors who will devour me, but I have always restrained myself! Though I lack courage, when I stepped like a tiger into the south of the Huai, you scurried like a rat into Shouchun with no one daring to show their face. Where are your brave generals and warriors now? You enjoy making grand claims to deceive the world, but how can you deceive everyone? In ancient times, when armies met, envoys mediated between them. I was not the first to create this strategy. We are not far apart, and we can still communicate.' After Bu completed his crossing, Shu personally led five thousand infantry and cavalry to display his forces along the Huai River. Bu's cavalry all laughed loudly at them from the north bank before returning. At that time, Xiao Jian of Donghai was serving as Chancellor of Langye, governing Ju, fortifying the city, and defending himself without communicating with Bu. Bu wrote to Jian: 'The empire rose in arms originally to eliminate Dong Zhuo. I killed Zhuo and came east, hoping to gather troops to welcome the Emperor west and restore the capital at Luoyang, but the various generals turned on each other, none willing to think of the state. I am from Wuyuan, more than five thousand li from Xuzhou, located in the northwest corner of the world, and I have not come to fight over the southeastern lands. Ju and Xiapi are not far apart, and we should communicate. If you persist in making each commandery an empire and each county a kingdom! In the past, when Yue Yi attacked Qi, he conquered more than seventy cities in a single breath, with only Ju and Jimo not falling. This was because they had Tian Dan within. Though I am not Yue Yi, you are also not Tian Dan. You should take my letter and discuss it thoroughly with your wise advisors.' When Jian received the letter, he immediately sent his secretary with a respectful note and offered five fine horses. Jian was soon attacked and defeated by Zang Ba, who captured his wealth and possessions. When Bu heard of this, he personally led infantry and cavalry toward Ju. Gao Shun advised against it: 'General, you personally killed Dong Zhuo, your might shakes the barbarians, and when you sit and look around, those near and far naturally fear and submit to you. You should not lightly go on campaign yourself. If you were to suffer a setback, the damage to your reputation would not be small.' Bu did not listen. Ba feared Bu's raids, so he indeed climbed the city walls and defended himself. Bu could not take the city and withdrew to Xiapi. Later, Ba made peace with Bu.]",
    "In the third year of Jian'an (198 CE), Lü Bu rebelled again to support Yuan Shu, sending Gao Shun to attack Liu Bei at Pei and defeating him. Cao Cao dispatched Xiahou Dun to rescue Bei, but he was defeated by Shun. Cao Cao then personally campaigned against Bu and, reaching the city, sent him a letter outlining the benefits of submission and the dangers of resistance. Bu wanted to surrender, but Chen Gong and others, knowing their own grave offenses, dissuaded him.",
    "[According to the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Emperor Xian': When Cao Cao's army reached Pengcheng, Chen Gong said to Bu: 'We should attack them first—the rested attacking the weary, we cannot fail.' Bu replied: 'It's better to wait for them to attack and push them into the Si River.' When Cao's army's attack became intense, Bu told his soldiers from atop the White Gate Tower: 'Do not struggle among yourselves. I will surrender to Lord Cao.' Chen Gong said: 'The rebel Cao Cao—what kind of lord is he! If we surrender today, it would be like an egg thrown against a stone. How could we possibly survive?']",
    "Bu sent someone to request aid from Yuan Shu and personally led over a thousand cavalry into battle. Defeated, he retreated to defend the city and dared not venture out again.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': Bu sent Xu Si and Wang Kai to seek urgent help from Yuan Shu. Shu said: 'Bu refused to give me his daughter, so he deserves to be defeated. Why come tell me about it?' Si and Kai replied: 'If Your Brilliance does not rescue Bu now, it will be your own undoing! If Bu falls, Your Brilliance will also fall.' At that time, Shu had usurped the imperial title, so they addressed him as 'Your Brilliance.' Shu then readied his troops to create the impression of supporting Bu. Bu feared that Shu would not send troops because his daughter had not been sent, so he wrapped his daughter in cotton, tied her to a horse, and personally escorted her out at night to Shu. They encountered Cao's garrison troops, arrows were exchanged, and they could not pass through, so they returned to the city. Bu wanted Chen Gong and Gao Shun to defend the city while he led cavalry to cut off Cao Cao's supply lines. Bu's wife said to him: 'General, it is right for you to personally go out and cut off Lord Cao's supply routes. But Gong and Shun have never gotten along. Once you leave, they will not work together to defend the city. If something goes wrong, where will you establish yourself? Please consider carefully and do not be misled by Gong and others. I was once abandoned by you in Chang'an and only survived because Pang Shu secretly sheltered me. Now you need not worry about me.' When Bu heard his wife's words, he was distressed and unable to decide. According to the 'Wei Chronicle': Chen Gong said to Bu: 'Lord Cao has come from afar and cannot sustain his position for long. If General, you lead infantry and cavalry to establish a position outside while I defend the city with the remaining troops, then if he turns toward you, I will attack his rear; if he attacks the city, you can rescue from outside. Within ten days, his provisions will be exhausted, and we can defeat him.' Bu agreed. But his wife said: 'In the past, the Cao family treated you like their own child, yet you left them. Now, if you entrust the entire city to General Chen, who has not treated you better than Cao Cao, abandoning your wife and children to lead an isolated force far away, if something should go wrong, how could I remain your wife?' So Bu decided against the plan.]",
    "Yuan Shu was also unable to provide assistance. Although Lü Bu was brave and fierce, he lacked strategic thinking and was suspicious by nature. He could not control his faction and trusted only his generals. His generals each had different ideas and doubted one another, so they were often defeated in battle. Cao Cao besieged them for three months, and the defenders became disunited. His generals Hou Cheng, Song Xian, and Wei Xu bound Chen Gong and led their troops in surrender.",
    "[According to the 'Nine Provinces Chronicle': Earlier, Lü Bu's cavalry commander Hou Cheng had sent a servant to tend to fifteen horses, but the servant drove all the horses away toward Pei city, intending to return to Liu Bei. Cheng personally led cavalry to pursue him and recovered all the horses. The generals gathered to congratulate Cheng, who brewed five or six hu of wine and hunted more than ten pigs. Before they could drink and eat, he first brought half a pig and five dou of wine to Bu, kneeling and saying: 'Recently, thanks to the General's grace, I recovered my lost horses. The generals have come to congratulate me, and I brewed a little wine and hunted some pigs. Before we dare to drink and eat, I first present this small token of respect.' Bu became furious and said: 'I have forbidden alcohol, yet you brew wine and gather with the generals to drink and eat like brothers—are you plotting to kill me?' Cheng was greatly frightened and left, abandoning the brewed wine and returning the generals' gifts. From then on, he harbored suspicions, and when Cao Cao besieged Xiapi, Cheng led his troops in surrender.]",
    "Lü Bu and his subordinates climbed the White Gate Tower. As the encirclement tightened, he descended and surrendered. He was bound alive, and Bu said: 'The bonds are too tight. Loosen them a little.' Cao Cao replied: 'When binding a tiger, one cannot be too gentle.' Bu pleaded: 'Lord, your only concern is Lü Bu, and now I have submitted. The empire is no longer a worry. If you lead the infantry and let me lead the cavalry, conquering the world would not be difficult.' Cao Cao showed a doubtful expression. Liu Bei stepped forward and said: 'My lord, have you forgotten how Bu treated Ding Jianyang and Grand Tutor Dong?' Cao Cao nodded in agreement. Bu then pointed at Bei and said: 'This man is the most untrustworthy of all.'",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': Bu said to Cao Cao: 'I treated my generals generously, yet in this crisis, they all betrayed me.' Cao Cao replied: 'You betrayed your wife and coveted the wives of your generals—how is that generous?' Bu fell silent. According to the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Emperor Xian': Bu asked Cao Cao: 'My lord, why are you so thin?' Cao Cao replied: 'How do you know me?' Bu said: 'We met at the Wen family garden in Luoyang.' Cao Cao said: 'Yes, I had forgotten. The reason I am thin is that I regret not having won you over earlier.' Bu said: 'Duke Huan of Qi spared Shen Hook and made Guan Zhong his minister. Now if you let me exhaust my strength in your service and be your vanguard, would that not be good?' As Bu's bonds were tight, he said to Liu Bei: 'Xuande, you are a seated guest while I am a captive. Can you not say a word to ease my situation?' Cao Cao smiled and said: 'Why don't you speak to him instead of appealing to my Lord Liu?' He intended to spare Bu and ordered that the bonds be loosened. But the Chief Clerk Wang Bi rushed forward and said: 'Bu is a violent prisoner. His troops are still nearby. We cannot loosen his bonds.' Cao Cao said: 'I originally wanted to ease them, but the Chief Clerk will not allow it. What can be done?']",
    "Thereupon, Lü Bu was strangled to death. The heads of Bu, Gong, Shun, and others were displayed at Xu before they were buried.",
    "[According to the 'Record of Heroes': Gao Shun was a man of integrity with a commanding presence. He did not drink alcohol or accept gifts. He led more than seven hundred troops, known as the 'Thousand-Man Unit,' all equipped with excellent armor and weapons. Wherever they attacked, they were victorious, earning the name 'Formation-Breaking Battalion.' Shun often advised Bu, saying: 'The destruction of families and countries is not due to a lack of loyal ministers or wise advisors but because they are not heeded. General, your actions lack careful consideration. You often speak rashly, and your mistakes are countless.' Bu recognized Shun's loyalty but could not follow his advice. After Hao Meng's rebellion, Bu grew more distant from Shun. Since Wei Xu had both external and internal connections, Bu took all the troops under Shun's command and gave them to Xu. When it came time for battle, Bu had Shun command the troops that Xu had been leading, yet Shun never showed any resentment.]",
    "Chen Gong",
    "When Cao Cao captured Chen Gong, he asked Gong if he wanted to save his elderly mother and daughter. Gong replied: 'I have heard that one who rules the world with filial piety does not sever people's familial relationships, and one who extends benevolence across the four seas does not cut off people's sacrificial rites. My elderly mother is in your hands, not in mine.' Cao Cao then took care of his mother until her death and arranged his daughter's marriage.",
    "[According to Yu's 'Brief Account': Chen Gong, courtesy name Gongtai, was a native of Dongjun. He was straightforward, righteous, and robust, and in his youth he associated with famous scholars throughout the empire. When chaos spread across the land, he initially followed Cao Cao but later became suspicious and joined Lü Bu. He devised strategies for Bu, but Bu often did not follow his plans. When Xiapi fell, the soldiers captured both Bu and Gong. Cao Cao met with them and discussed their past, which is why Bu asked to be spared. Cao Cao said to Gong: 'Gongtai, you always claimed to have abundant wisdom and plans, but how have things turned out?' Gong looked at Bu and said: 'It is simply because this man did not follow my advice that we have come to this. If he had listened to me, we might not have been captured.' Cao Cao smiled and said: 'What about the current situation?' Gong replied: 'As a subject I have been disloyal, as a son I have been unfilial. Death is my lot.' Cao Cao said: 'If that is so, what about your elderly mother?' Gong said: 'I have heard that one who rules the world with filial piety does not harm other people's parents. Whether my elderly mother lives or dies depends on you, my lord.' Cao Cao asked: 'What about your wife and children?' Gong replied: 'I have heard that one who extends benevolent governance throughout the world does not cut off people's sacrificial lineages. Whether my wife and children survive also depends on you, my lord.' Cao Cao did not respond further. Gong said: 'I request to go out and be executed, to uphold military law.' He then hurried out and could not be stopped. Cao Cao wept as he sent him off, but Gong did not look back. After Gong's death, Cao Cao treated his family even better than before.]",
    "Chen Deng",
    "Chen Deng, courtesy name Yuanlong, had a prestigious reputation in Guangling. He contributed significantly to outmaneuvering Lü Bu and was promoted to General Who Subdues the Waves. He died at the age of thirty-nine. Later, when Xu Si and Liu Bei were both sitting with Liu Biao, the Governor of Jingzhou, Biao and Bei were discussing the notable figures of the empire. Si said: 'Chen Yuanlong is a man of the lakes and seas, with an undiminished arrogance.' Bei asked Biao: 'Is what Master Xu says right or wrong?' Biao replied: 'If I say it's wrong, this gentleman is speaking of a good man, and I shouldn't contradict him without cause; if I say it's right, Yuanlong's reputation weighs heavily throughout the empire.' Bei asked Si: 'You mention his arrogance—do you have any specific incident?' Si said: 'In the past, during the chaos, I passed through Xiapi and met Yuanlong. He showed no regard for the host-guest relationship and did not speak with me for a long time. He lay on the upper couch and made me lie on the lower couch.' Bei said: 'You have the reputation of a national scholar. Now with the empire in great turmoil and the emperor displaced, one would expect you to worry about the country and forget personal concerns, with the intention of saving the world. Yet you inquire about fields and houses, speaking nothing worth considering. This is what Yuanlong would avoid, so why would he speak with you? If he were petty-minded, he might have wanted to sleep on a hundred-foot tower and make you sleep on the ground—what's the concern about upper and lower couches?' Biao laughed heartily. Bei continued: 'As for Yuanlong's literary and martial abilities, courage and ambition, one would have to seek a comparison in ancient times. It's difficult to find someone comparable at a moment's notice.'",
    "[According to the 'Deeds of Previous Worthies': Deng was loyal, bright, deep-thinking, and had great vision. From a young age, he had the ambition to support the world and aid the people. He extensively read classical texts, was refined in literary arts, and thoroughly understood all ancient classics and writings. At the age of twenty-five, he was recommended as Filial and Incorrupt and appointed as the Magistrate of Dongyang, where he cared for the elderly and raised orphans, treating the people as if they were injured. At that time, there was a famine, and Governor Tao Qian recommended Deng as Agricultural Colonel. He surveyed suitable farmlands and maximized irrigation benefits, resulting in abundant harvests of rice. When sent on a mission to Xu, Cao Cao appointed Deng as Grand Administrator of Guangling, instructing him to secretly gather forces to deal with Lü Bu. In Guangling, Deng was clear in rewards and punishments, and his authority and trust spread widely. The sea bandits led by Xue Zhou, numbering more than ten thousand households, surrendered to him. Within less than a year, his achievements were realized, and the people both feared and loved him. Deng said: 'Now they can be used.' When Cao Cao arrived at Xiapi, Deng led the commandery troops as the vanguard. At that time, Deng's younger brothers were inside Xiapi city. Bu held Deng's three brothers hostage, hoping to negotiate an alliance. Deng remained firm and continued the siege. Bu's subordinate Zhang Hong, fearing future troubles, brought Deng's three brothers out at night to join Deng. After Bu was defeated, Deng was promoted to General Who Subdues the Waves for his achievements, winning the hearts of people in the Jiang and Huai regions. He then had ambitions to conquer the south of the Yangtze. Sun Ce sent troops to attack Deng at Kuangqi city. When the enemy first arrived, their banners and armor covered the water. Everyone below Deng felt that since the enemy outnumbered the commandery troops tenfold, they might not be able to resist and should withdraw to avoid the enemy, leaving an empty city. They reasoned that water people living on land could not stay long and would eventually withdraw. Deng raised his voice sternly: 'I have received the imperial mandate to guard this land. In the past, when Ma Wenyuan held this position, he was able to pacify the southern Hundred Yue and eliminate the northern barbarians. Since I cannot eliminate these villains, how can I speak of fleeing from bandits! I will give my life to repay the state and uphold righteousness to correct chaos. The Way of Heaven follows the righteous—victory must be ours.' He closed the gates for self-defense, feigning weakness and not engaging in battle. His officers and soldiers remained silent, as if no one was there. Deng climbed the city wall to observe the situation and, knowing he could strike, ordered his soldiers to prepare their weapons overnight. At dawn, he opened the south gate, led his army toward the enemy camp, and had cavalry raid from behind. The enemy was in disarray as they tried to form ranks and could not return to their ships. Deng personally beat the war drum, unleashing his troops, and the enemy was utterly defeated, abandoning their ships and fleeing in all directions. Deng pursued the victory, killing tens of thousands. The enemy, resentful of their defeat, soon raised a larger army against Deng. Deng, knowing his forces were inadequate, sent Officer Chen Jiao to seek reinforcements from Cao Cao. Deng secretly set up a military camp ten li from the city, ordering men to gather firewood and arrange it in bundles, placing them ten paces apart in rows. He ordered them all lit at night, and when the fires blazed, those on the city walls cheered as if a great army had arrived. The enemy saw the fires, panicked, and fled. Deng led his troops in pursuit, beheading ten thousand. Deng was then transferred to be Grand Administrator of Dongcheng. The officials and people of Guangling, cherishing his kindness and virtue, uprooted the entire commandery to follow him, with the elderly and weak carrying children on their backs in pursuit. Deng explained to them and told them to return, saying: 'Your Grand Administrator was in your commandery, repeatedly facing the Wu invaders, and fortunately prevailed. What worry do you have about not having a good lord?' Sun Quan then took control of the lands beyond the Yangtze. Whenever Cao Cao stood by the great river and sighed, he regretted not having followed Chen Yuanlong's plan earlier, allowing the 'boar' to grow its claws and fangs. Emperor Wen (Cao Pi) posthumously honored Deng's achievements and appointed Deng's son Xi as a Gentleman of the Palace.]"

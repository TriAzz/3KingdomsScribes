    "The Biography of Emperor Wu (Cao Cao)",
    "Emperor Wu (posthumous title), also known as Cao Cao, was a native of Qiao in Pei Commandery. His courtesy name was Mengde, and he was a descendant of Cao Can, who had served as Chancellor of the Han Dynasty.",
    "[According to the \"Biography of Cao Man\": Cao Cao also had the name Jili and the childhood nickname Aman. Wang Shen's \"Book of Wei\" states: His ancestors descended from the Yellow Emperor. During the era of Emperor Gaoyao, Lu Zhong's son named An began the Cao surname. When King Wu of Zhou defeated the Shang Dynasty, he preserved the descendants of ancient lineages and enfeoffed Cao Xia at Zhu. During the Spring and Autumn period, they participated in the alliance meetings. By the Warring States period, they were conquered by the state of Chu. Their descendants scattered, with some settling in Pei. When Emperor Gaozu of Han rose to power, Cao Can was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Pingyang for his meritorious service. The title was inherited through generations, sometimes interrupted but later restored, and their descendants continue to reside in Rongcheng to this day.]",
    "During Emperor Huan's reign, Cao Teng served as a Palace Regular Attendant and Chief of the Imperial Harem, and was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Feiting.",
    "[According to Sima Biao's \"Continuation of the History of Han\": Teng's father Jie, courtesy name Yuanwei, was known for his kindness and generosity. Once, a neighbor lost a pig and found one similar to it at Jie's home. When the neighbor claimed it, Jie did not argue. Later, the neighbor's lost pig returned home, causing him great embarrassment. He brought the pig he had claimed along with an apology to Jie, who accepted them with a smile. This earned him great respect in the community. Jie's eldest son was Bo Xing, followed by Zhong Xing and Shu Xing. Cao Teng, courtesy name Ji Xing, was appointed as a Yellow Gate Attendant in his youth. In the first year of Yongning, Empress Dowager Deng ordered the selection of young, well-mannered Yellow Gate Attendants to accompany the Crown Prince, and Teng was chosen. The Crown Prince developed a special fondness for Teng, treating him differently from others in terms of meals and rewards. When Emperor Shun ascended the throne, Teng became a Junior Yellow Gate Attendant and was eventually promoted to Palace Regular Attendant and Chief of the Imperial Harem. He served in the imperial palace for over thirty years under four emperors without any misconduct. He enjoyed recommending talented individuals without ever harming others. Among those he recommended were Yu Fang and Bian Shao from Chenliiu, Yan Gu and Zhang Wen from Nanyang, Zhang Huan from Hongnong, and Tang Xi Dian from Yingchuan, all of whom attained high positions, yet Teng never boasted about his role in their advancement. Once, the Governor of Shu Commandery sent tribute gifts to Teng through a clerk. Zhong Hao, the Imperial Inspector of Yi Province, discovered the letter at Hangu Pass and reported to the Emperor that Teng had inappropriately engaged in external relations as an internal servant, requesting that Teng be dismissed and punished. The Emperor replied: \"The letter came from outside; Teng did not send anything out, so this is not his fault.\" Thus, Hao's report was dismissed. Teng harbored no resentment and continued to praise Hao for his loyalty to the Emperor. Later, when Hao became Minister of Works, he told others: \"My position today is due to Lord Cao's kindness.\" All of Teng's actions were of this nature. When Emperor Huan came to power, he recognized Teng as a loyal servant of the previous emperor who had demonstrated filial piety and loyalty, and thus enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Feiting and granted him the special position of Imperial Attendant. In the third year of Taihe, Teng was posthumously honored as Emperor Gao.]",
    "Teng's adopted son Cao Song succeeded him and rose to the position of Grand Commandant, though the details of his origins remain unclear.",
    "[The \"Continuation of the History of Han\" states: Song's courtesy name was Ju Gao. He was honest, cautious, and known for loyalty and filial piety wherever he served. As Commandant of the Capital District, Emperor Ling promoted him to Minister of Agriculture, then Grand Herald, and eventually he replaced Cui Lie as Grand Commandant. In the first year of Huangchu, Song was posthumously honored as Emperor Tai. The \"Biography of Cao Man\" written by scholars from Wu and Guo Fan's \"Stories of the Age\" both claim that Song was the son of the Xiahou clan and the uncle of Xiahou Dun. This would make Cao Cao and Xiahou Dun cousins.]",
    "Song was the father of Cao Cao.",
    "In his youth, Cao Cao was quick-witted and resourceful, but also roamed freely and engaged in acts of chivalry without focusing on proper conduct. Thus, people of his time did not recognize his exceptional qualities.",
    "[The \"Biography of Cao Man\" states: In his youth, Cao Cao enjoyed falconry and hunting dogs, spending his time in idle pursuits. His uncle repeatedly complained about this to Cao Song. Troubled by these complaints, Cao Cao later pretended to have facial paralysis when encountering his uncle on the road. His uncle was concerned and asked what had happened, to which Cao Cao replied: \"I was suddenly struck by a malevolent wind.\" The uncle informed Song about this, who was alarmed and summoned Cao Cao, whose face appeared normal. Song asked: \"Your uncle said you suffered from facial paralysis. Have you recovered?\" Cao Cao replied: \"I never had facial paralysis. I have simply fallen out of my uncle's favor, so he spreads falsehoods about me.\" Song became suspicious after this. From then on, whenever the uncle complained about Cao Cao, Song no longer believed him, giving Cao Cao greater freedom to act as he pleased.]",
    "Only Qiao Xuan from Liang state and He Yong from Nanyang recognized his exceptional talents. Xuan said to Cao Cao: \"The empire is about to fall into chaos, and only a person of extraordinary talent can save it. Perhaps you are the one capable of bringing peace!\"",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: Grand Commandant Qiao Xuan, renowned for his ability to assess talent, was impressed by Cao Cao and said: \"I have met many famous scholars in my life, but none like you! Take good care of yourself. I am old now and wish to entrust my wife and children to your care.\" This further enhanced Cao Cao's reputation.]",
    "[The \"Continuation of the History of Han\" states: Xuan, courtesy name Gongzu, was strict, clear-minded, and talented in administration and in judging character. Zhang Fan's \"Records of Han\" notes: Xuan served in both central and local government, known for his firm decisions, humility, and respect for scholars regardless of his noble rank. During the Guanghe period, he served as Grand Commandant but resigned due to prolonged illness. He was appointed as Grand Palace Grandee and died in such poverty that his coffin could not be properly stored. For this reason, contemporaries regarded him as a distinguished minister.]",
    "[The \"Stories of the Age\" states: Xuan advised Cao Cao: \"You are not yet well-known. You should befriend Xu Zijiang.\" Cao Cao then visited Zijiang, who accepted him, helping him establish his reputation.]",
    "[Sun Sheng's \"Miscellaneous Records of Similarities and Differences\" states: Cao Cao once secretly entered the chambers of the Palace Regular Attendant Zhang Rang, who discovered him. Rang danced with a halberd in the courtyard, but Cao Cao escaped by leaping over the wall. His exceptional talent and martial prowess made him virtually untouchable. He extensively studied various texts, particularly military treatises, compiled various military works into a book called \"Essential Military Matters,\" and annotated Sun Wu's thirteen chapters on warfare, all of which have been passed down. Once, he asked Xu Zijiang: \"How would you compare me to others?\" Zijiang did not answer. When pressed, Zijiang said: \"You would be a capable minister in times of peace, but a scheming villain in times of chaos.\" Cao Cao laughed heartily at this.]",
    "At the age of twenty, Cao Cao was recommended as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate and appointed as a Gentleman. He was assigned as the Northern District Captain of Luoyang, then transferred to become the Magistrate of Dunqiu.",
    "[The \"Biography of Cao Man\" states: When Cao Cao first took office as District Captain, he repaired the four gates and created five-colored clubs, hanging more than ten on each side of the gates. Anyone who violated the law, regardless of their status, was beaten to death with these clubs. Several months later, a relative of Jian Shuo, Emperor Ling's favored eunuch, was walking at night and was killed by Cao Cao. The entire capital became fearful, and no one dared to violate the laws. Although court favorites resented him, they could not harm him. Instead, they collectively recommended him for promotion, resulting in his transfer to Dunqiu as magistrate.]",
    "He was later summoned to become a Consultant.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: Cao Cao's cousin's husband, the Marquis of Jiaqiang Song Qi, was executed, and Cao was implicated and dismissed from office. Later, because of his knowledge of ancient studies, he was again summoned to serve as a Consultant. Earlier, Grand General Dou Wu and Grand Tutor Chen Fan had plotted to eliminate the eunuchs, but instead were themselves destroyed. Cao Cao submitted a memorial asserting that Wu and others had been upright but were wrongfully accused, while corrupt officials filled the court and good people were suppressed. His words were very direct, but Emperor Ling ignored them. Later, an edict instructed the Three Excellencies (the three highest officials) to report on ineffective county governance that caused people to create satirical songs, with the implication that such officials should be dismissed. The Three Excellencies, however, were biased and sought only to please those in power. Bribes were exchanged, the powerful who caused grievances were not reported, while the weak who upheld principles were falsely accused. Cao Cao was distressed by this. That year, due to natural disasters, the emperor sought advice on governance. Cao Cao again submitted a direct memorial criticizing the Three Excellencies for deliberately avoiding reporting on the powerful and their relatives. When the memorial reached the emperor, he was moved and showed it to the Three Excellencies to reprimand them. Those who had been summoned due to satirical songs were all appointed as Consultants. After this, governance deteriorated further and powerful bullies grew more rampant, causing much destruction. Cao Cao realized he could not rectify the situation and ceased offering advice.]",
    "At the end of the Guanghe era, the Yellow Turban Rebellion erupted. Cao Cao was appointed as Cavalry Commandant to suppress the rebels in Yingchuan. He was then transferred to become Governor of Jinan, a region with more than ten counties. Many local officials there curried favor with powerful families and engaged in corruption. Cao Cao reported and removed eight of them. He prohibited excessive sacrificial rituals, causing corrupt individuals to flee. The entire commandery became well-governed.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: The local officials accepted bribes and relied on powerful connections, which previous governors had not reported. When they heard of Cao Cao's arrival, all were removed from office. Everyone, high and low, trembled with fear, and the corrupt fled to other commanderies. Governance was greatly improved, and the entire commandery became peaceful and orderly. Earlier, Liu Zhang, Prince Jing of Chengyang, had been honored with shrines for his service to the Han Dynasty. Other commanderies in Qingzhou followed this example, with Jinan being especially excessive, establishing more than six hundred shrines. Merchants sometimes used the carriages and attendants of high officials, with musicians and entertainers, becoming increasingly extravagant. This led to poverty among the people, yet no magistrate over generations dared to prohibit these practices. When Cao Cao arrived, he destroyed all shrine buildings and prohibited officials and commoners from making sacrifices at these shrines. When he later came to power, he eliminated matters relating to evil spirits and improper deities, thus ending excessive sacrificial practices from that time onward.]",
    "After some time, he was summoned to become the Governor of Dong Commandery, but he declined, citing illness and returning to his hometown.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: At this time, powerful officials dominated the court, and noble relatives behaved lawlessly. Cao Cao could not compromise his principles to please them. Having repeatedly offended them, he feared bringing disaster upon his family and requested to remain in the Palace Guard. He was appointed as a Consultant but often claimed illness and returned to his hometown. He built a residence outside the city where he studied books and historical records in spring and summer, and hunted with bow and arrow in autumn and winter for his amusement.]",
    "Soon after, Wang Fen, the Inspector of Ji Province, along with Xu You from Nanyang and Zhou Jing from Pei State, gathered influential men and plotted to depose Emperor Ling and install the Marquis of Hefei. They informed Cao Cao of their plan, but he refused to participate. Consequently, Fen and his conspirators failed.",
    "[Sima Biao's \"Chronicles of the Nine Provinces\" states: At that time, Chen Fan's son Yi met with the diviner Xiang Kai from Pingyuan at Wang Fen's residence. Kai said: \"The heavenly signs are unfavorable for eunuchs. The powerful eunuchs and palace attendants will be destroyed.\" Yi was pleased. Fen said: \"If that is so, I am willing to lead the effort to eliminate them.\" Thus, he formed a conspiracy with Xu You and others. Emperor Ling planned to make a northern tour to his former residence in Hejian, and Fen and his associates plotted to take advantage of this opportunity. They submitted a memorial stating that Black Mountain bandits were attacking counties and requested permission to raise troops. However, a red vapor appeared in the northern sky stretching east to west. The Court Astrologer reported: \"This indicates a conspiracy. The northern tour should be canceled.\" The emperor then stopped his planned journey. He ordered Fen to disband his troops and soon summoned him to court. Fen, fearing the consequences, committed suicide.]",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" records Cao Cao's refusal to Wang Fen as follows: \"The matter of deposing and installing rulers is the greatest inauspicious act under heaven. In ancient times, those who succeeded in such actions, such as Yi Yin and Huo Guang, carefully weighed the consequences before acting. Yi Yin possessed the utmost loyalty, held the position of Chancellor, and stood at the pinnacle of government offices, thus he could advance or withdraw rulers as he determined necessary. As for Huo Guang, he was entrusted with governing the state, held the position of a clan minister, relied internally on the Empress Dowager's authority, and externally had the support of various ministers who shared his desires. The Marquis of Changyi had only recently taken the throne, had no powerful favorites, the court lacked forthright ministers, and the deliberations were kept among a small circle. Thus Huo's plan succeeded as easily as rolling a round object or breaking something rotten. Now you gentlemen see only the ease of past successes but fail to perceive the difficulties of the present situation. Consider your own strength—how does your gathering of followers compare to the Seven States? And how does the noble status of the Marquis of Hefei compare to that of the kings of Wu and Chu? Yet you attempt such extraordinary actions and expect success. Is this not dangerous?\"]",
    "The frontier commander Bian Zhang and Han Sui from Jincheng murdered their Inspector and Commandery Governor and rebelled, gathering a force of over 100,000 men. This caused great disturbance throughout the empire. Cao Cao was summoned to serve as Colonel Who Arranges the Army.",
    "At this time, Emperor Ling died and the Crown Prince ascended the throne, with the Empress Dowager serving as regent. The Grand General He Jin conspired with Yuan Shao to eliminate the eunuchs, but the Empress Dowager refused to permit this. Jin then summoned Dong Zhuo, intending to intimidate the Empress Dowager.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: When Cao Cao heard of this, he laughed and said: \"The position of eunuch officials has existed since ancient times. The problem is that rulers should not grant them authority and favor, allowing them to reach such a state. To punish their crimes, one need only execute the chief culprits—a single prison officer would suffice. Why this commotion about summoning external generals? If they intend to execute all the eunuchs, the plan will certainly be leaked, and I foresee its failure.\"]",
    "Before Dong Zhuo's arrival, He Jin was assassinated. When Dong Zhuo arrived, he deposed the Emperor and made him the Prince of Hongnong, then installed Emperor Xian. The capital fell into great disorder. Dong Zhuo appointed Cao Cao as Colonel of Resolute Cavalry and wanted to involve him in his schemes. Cao Cao then changed his name and secretly fled eastward.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: Cao Cao believed that Dong Zhuo would eventually be destroyed, so he declined the appointment and fled to his hometown. With several horsemen, he passed by the home of an old friend, Lü Boshe in Chengao. Boshe was not home, and his son and guests attempted to rob Cao Cao, taking his horses and possessions. Cao Cao killed several of them with his sword.]",
    "[The \"Stories of the Age\" states: Cao Cao visited Boshe's house. Boshe was away, but his five sons were present and prepared to receive guests with proper hospitality. Cao Cao, having defied Dong Zhuo's orders, suspected they might be plotting against him, so he killed eight people with his sword that night and fled.]",
    "[Sun Sheng's \"Miscellaneous Records\" states: Cao Cao heard the sound of food utensils and thought they were plotting against him, so he killed them that night. Afterward, he lamented: \"Better that I wrong others than others wrong me!\" Then he departed.]",
    "After passing through the frontier, Cao Cao reached Zhongmou, where the head of the post station suspected him and had him arrested and taken to the county office. Some locals recognized him and pleaded for his release, which was granted.",
    "[The \"Stories of the Age\" states: In Zhongmou, he was suspected of being a fugitive and detained by the county authorities. At that time, the assistant magistrate had already received orders from Dong Zhuo; only the Chief Clerk knew Cao Cao's identity and, considering that in chaotic times it was unwise to detain a hero, recommended his release.]",
    "Subsequently, Dong Zhuo killed the Empress Dowager and the Prince of Hongnong. When Cao Cao reached Chenliu, he distributed his family wealth and gathered righteous troops to punish Dong Zhuo. In the twelfth month of winter, he first raised his army at Yiwu.",
    "[The \"Stories of the Age\" states: Wei Zi, a Filial and Incorrupt candidate from Chenliu, provided Cao Cao with his family wealth to raise troops, gathering a force of 5,000 men.]",
    "This was the sixth year of Zhongping.",
    "In the first month of spring in the first year of Chuping, the Rear General Yuan Shu, the Governor of Ji Province Han Fu,",
    "[The \"Record of Heroes\" states: Fu's courtesy name was Wenjie, a native of Yingchuan. He served as a Palace Attendant Censor. Dong Zhuo recommended him as Governor of Ji Province. At that time, Ji Province was populous and well-supplied with troops and provisions. When Yuan Shao was in Bohai, Fu feared he might raise troops and sent several attendants to monitor him, preventing any movement. Qiao Mao, the Governor of Dong Commandery, forged a document from the Three Excellencies in the capital to various provinces, detailing Dong Zhuo's crimes and stating: \"We are being coerced and have no means of saving ourselves. We look to righteous armies to relieve the nation's crisis.\" When Fu received this document, he consulted his attendants, asking: \"Should we now assist the Yuan clan or Dong Zhuo?\" Liu Zihui, the Attending Officer of the Central Bureau, replied: \"We are raising troops for the sake of the nation. Why speak of Yuan or Dong?\" Fu, realizing the inadequacy of his words, showed embarrassment. Zihui further said: \"Military action is an inauspicious affair; we should not take the lead. We should observe what other provinces do; if they take action, we can join them. Ji Province is not weaker than other provinces, and no one else's achievements will surpass those of Ji Province.\" Fu agreed with this. Fu then wrote to Yuan Shao, describing Dong Zhuo's evils and allowing him to raise troops.]",
    "The Inspector of Yu Province Kong Rong,",
    "[The \"Record of Heroes\" states: Rong's courtesy name was Gongxu, a native of Chenliu. Zhang Fan's \"Records of Han\" records Zheng Tai's description of Dong Zhuo: \"Kong Gongxu excels in elegant discourse and lofty debate, capable of reviving the withered with a breath.\"]",
    "The Inspector of Yan Province Liu Dai,",
    "[Dai was the elder brother of Liu Yao, as recorded in the \"Records of Wu.\"]",
    "The Governor of Henei Wang Kuang,",
    "[The \"Record of Heroes\" states: Kuang's courtesy name was Gongjie, a native of Taishan. He was generous with wealth, fond of helping others, and known for his chivalry. He was summoned to the office of Grand General He Jin and sent to Xuzhou to acquire five hundred strong crossbows for the capital. When Jin was defeated, Kuang returned to his hometown. He began his career as the Governor of Henei. Xie Cheng's \"Later Han History\" states: Kuang was close to Cai Yong in his youth. That year, he was defeated by Dong Zhuo's army and fled back to Taishan, where he gathered several thousand brave warriors, intending to join forces with Zhang Miao. Kuang had previously killed Humuban, the Captain of the Guards. Humuban's relatives, out of anger, allied with Cao Cao and together killed Kuang.]",
    "The Governor of Bohai Yuan Shao, the Governor of Chenliu Zhang Miao, the Governor of Dong Commandery Qiao Mao,",
    "[The \"Record of Heroes\" states: Mao's courtesy name was Yuanwei, a nephew of Qiao Xuan. He previously served as the Inspector of Yan Province, where he was highly respected for his authority and kindness.]",
    "The Governor of Shanyang Yuan Yi,",
    "[Yi's courtesy name was Boye, Yuan Shao's cousin. He served as the Magistrate of Chang'an. Zhang Chao of Hejian once recommended Yi to Grand Commandant Zhu Jun, praising him as \"possessing exceptional virtues and the capacity to handle affairs of the time. His loyalty, honesty, and straightforwardness are heaven-bestowed. As for his comprehensive knowledge of texts, mastery of various schools of thought, ability to compose poetry from high ground, and recognize objects by name, there is no one who can match him today.\" This account appears in Chao's collection. The \"Record of Heroes\" states: Shao later appointed Yi as Inspector of Yang Province, but he was defeated by Yuan Shu. Cao Cao remarked: \"Among those who are tall and diligent in study, only Yuan Boye and I remain.\" This statement appears in Emperor Wen's \"Canonical Discourses.\"]",
    "And the Administrator of Jinan Bao Xin",
    "[Information about Xin can be found in the biography of his son Xun.]",
    "All simultaneously raised troops at this time, each commanding tens of thousands of men, and they appointed Yuan Shao as their leader. Cao Cao was named General Who Displays Martial Might.",
    "In the second month, when Dong Zhuo heard of the uprising, he moved the Emperor to Chang'an. Dong Zhuo remained in Luoyang and burned the imperial palaces. At this time, Yuan Shao was stationed in Henei; Zhang Miao, Liu Dai, Qiao Mao, and Yuan Yi were stationed at Suanzao; Yuan Shu was in Nanyang; Kong Rong was in Yingchuan; and Han Fu was in Ye. Dong Zhuo's forces were strong, and Yuan Shao and the others dared not advance first. Cao Cao said: \"We have raised righteous troops to eliminate brutality and chaos. A great force has assembled, yet you gentlemen still hesitate? Had Dong Zhuo heard of the uprising in the east and used the authority of the royal house while controlling the strategic territory of the two Zhous, facing east to confront the empire—even with his immoral conduct, he would still be a formidable threat. Now he has burned the palaces and forcibly relocated the Emperor. The entire realm is in turmoil, not knowing where to turn. This is heaven's time to destroy him. With one battle, the empire can be settled. We must not miss this opportunity.\" He then led his troops westward, intending to occupy Chengao. Zhang Miao sent his general Wei Zi to divide his forces and follow Cao Cao.",
    "Upon reaching the Bian River at Yingyang, they encountered Dong Zhuo's general Xu Rong. The battle went poorly, with many soldiers killed or wounded. Cao Cao was hit by a stray arrow, and his horse was injured. His cousin Cao Hong gave his horse to Cao Cao, allowing him to escape under cover of darkness. Seeing that Cao Cao commanded few troops yet had fought fiercely all day, Rong believed that Suanzao would not be easy to attack, so he also withdrew his forces.",
    "When Cao Cao reached Suanzao, the combined armies totaled over 100,000 men. They spent their days feasting and holding grand gatherings, without planning how to advance. Cao Cao reprimanded them and devised a strategy: \"If you gentlemen will listen to my plan: have Bohai lead the forces from Henei to approach Mengjin, while the generals from Suanzao guard Chengao, occupy Aocang, and block Zhuanyuan and Taigu, taking control of these strategic passes. Have General Yuan lead the troops from Nanyang to Dan and Xi, and enter through the Wu Pass to shake the three regions of the capital. All should build high fortifications and deep encampments, avoiding direct battle. Create diversionary troops to demonstrate our strength to the world, and with righteousness overthrow rebellion—victory will be swift. Now, our troops have mobilized for a just cause, yet we remain hesitant and do not advance. We are disappointing the expectations of the world. I am ashamed for all of you!\" However, Zhang Miao and the others could not implement his plan.",
    "With his own forces being few, Cao Cao went with Xiahou Dun and others to Yang Province to recruit troops. The Inspector Chen Wen and the Governor of Danyang Zhou Xin provided over 4,000 men. When he returned to Longkang, many soldiers deserted.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: The troops planned to mutiny and burned Cao Cao's tent at night. Cao Cao personally killed dozens of men with his sword, scattering the rest, and managed to escape the camp. Only over 500 men remained loyal.]",
    "At Di and Jianping, he regathered troops and obtained more than 1,000 men, then advanced to camp in Henei.",
    "Liu Dai and Qiao Mao harbored enmity toward each other. Dai killed Mao and appointed Wang Gong as Governor of Dong Commandery.",
    "Yuan Shao and Han Fu planned to install Liu Yu, the Governor of You Province, as emperor, but Cao Cao opposed this.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" records Cao Cao's response to Yuan Shao: \"Dong Zhuo's crimes have aroused outrage throughout the realm. We have gathered a great force and raised righteous troops, with support from far and near—this is because we are motivated by righteousness. Now, the young Emperor is weak and controlled by treacherous ministers, but he has not committed the transgressions that led to the downfall of Changyi. If we suddenly replace him, how could the empire accept this? You gentlemen may face north, but I shall face west.\"]",
    "Yuan Shao once obtained a jade seal and raised it to his elbow while in Cao Cao's presence, causing Cao Cao to laugh but inwardly despise him.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: Cao Cao laughed heartily and said: \"I will not listen to you.\" Yuan Shao then sent someone to persuade Cao Cao, saying: \"Now Lord Yuan has great influence and strong forces. His two sons are grown, and among the heroes of the realm, who could surpass him?\" Cao Cao did not respond. From then on, he increasingly disrespected Yuan Shao and plotted to eliminate him.]",
    "In the spring of the second year, Yuan Shao and Han Fu proceeded to install Liu Yu as emperor, but Yu ultimately did not dare to accept the position.",
    "In the fourth month of summer, Dong Zhuo returned to Chang'an.",

    "The Black Mountain bandits Yu Du, Bai Rao, Sui Gu, and others",
    "[The character 眭 is pronounced \"sui.\"]",
    "with a force of over 100,000 men ravaged Wei Commandery and Dong Commandery. Wang Gong could not resist them, so Cao Cao led his troops into Dong Commandery and attacked Bai Rao at Puyang, defeating him. Yuan Shao then recommended Cao Cao to be appointed as Governor of Dong Commandery, based at Dongwuyang.",
    "In the spring of the third year, Cao Cao's army was stationed at Dunqiu when Yu Du and his forces attacked Dongwuyang. Cao Cao then led his troops westward into the mountains to attack Yu Du's main camp.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: All the generals believed they should return to defend their own territory. Cao Cao said: \"Sun Bin saved Zhao by attacking Wei, and Geng Yan wanted to march to Xi'an to attack Linzi. If the bandits hear that we have gone west, they will return, and Wuyang will be relieved. If they do not return, we can defeat their main camp, and they certainly will not be able to capture Wuyang.\" So he proceeded with his plan.]",
    "When Yu Du heard of this, he abandoned Wuyang and returned. Cao Cao intercepted and attacked Sui Gu, and then attacked the Xiongnu leader Yu Fuluo at Neihuang, defeating them both decisively.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: Yu Fuluo was the son of the Southern Shanyu. During the Zhongping era, Xiongnu troops were mobilized, and Yu Fuluo led them to assist the Han. However, their home territory rebelled and killed the Southern Shanyu, so Yu Fuluo remained in China with his forces. Taking advantage of the chaos in the realm, he joined with the White Wave bandits from Xihe, defeating Taiyuan and Henei, and plundering various commanderies.]",
    "In the fourth month of summer, Imperial Counselor Wang Yun and Lü Bu together killed Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo's generals Li Jue, Guo Si, and others killed Yun and attacked Bu. Bu was defeated and fled east through the Wu Pass. Li Jue and his associates then dominated the court.",
    "The Yellow Turbans from Qing Province, numbering one million, entered Yan Province, killed Zheng Sui, the Administrator of Rencheng, and moved into Dongping. Liu Dai wanted to attack them, but Bao Xin advised against it, saying: \"The bandits now number a million, and the common people are terrified. Our soldiers have no will to fight and cannot match them. Observing the bandits, they move in groups without supply wagons, relying solely on plunder for resources. Rather than engaging them directly, we should conserve our strength and establish strong defenses. If they wish to fight but cannot, and if they cannot successfully attack us, they will inevitably scatter. Later, we can select elite troops, occupy strategic positions, and defeat them.\" Dai did not follow this advice and engaged in battle, resulting in his death.",
    "[The \"Stories of the Age\" states: After Dai's death, Chen Gong said to Cao Cao: \"The province now has no leader, and imperial authority has been severed. Allow me to persuade the provincial officials, and you should come to govern it. With these resources, you can unify the realm—this is the path to becoming a hegemon.\" Gong then persuaded the Attendant Official and Chief Clerk: \"The empire is now fractured, and our province has no governor. Cao of Dong Commandery is a talent of the age. If we invite him to govern the province, he will surely bring peace to the people.\" Bao Xin and others agreed with this assessment.]",
    "Bao Xin, along with provincial official Wan Qian and others, went to Dong Commandery to invite Cao Cao to become the Governor of Yan Province. Cao Cao then led his troops to attack the Yellow Turbans east of Shouzhang. Bao Xin fought bravely but died in battle, though the enemy was eventually defeated.",
    "[The \"Book of Wei\" states: Cao Cao led over a thousand infantry and cavalry to survey the battlefield but unexpectedly encountered the enemy camp. The battle went poorly, with several hundred casualties, forcing him to withdraw. The enemy soon advanced. Having been bandits for a long time and having experienced numerous victories, the Yellow Turbans had become exceptionally fierce fighters. Cao Cao had few veteran soldiers, and his new recruits were untrained. The entire army was fearful. Cao Cao personally donned armor and a helmet, inspected the troops himself, clearly established rewards and punishments, and thus revived their morale. Seizing opportunities to attack, he gradually forced the enemy to retreat. The bandits then sent a letter to Cao Cao saying: \"In the past at Jinan, you destroyed sacred altars. Our way is the same as the Central Yellow and Supreme Unity. You seemed to understand the Way then but are now deluded. The Han dynasty's mandate has ended, and the Yellow family must be established. Heaven's great cycle cannot be preserved by your talent and strength.\" Upon seeing this letter, Cao Cao condemned their crimes and repeatedly offered them paths to surrender. He then set clever ambushes and engaged in battle day and night, capturing prisoners with each engagement, until the enemy retreated.]",
    "Though they searched for Bao Xin's remains, they could not be found. The troops carved a wooden figure resembling Bao Xin, worshipped it, and mourned him. Cao Cao pursued the Yellow Turbans to Jibei, where they begged to surrender. In winter, he accepted the surrender of over 300,000 soldiers and more than a million men, women, and children. He recruited the most capable among them and called them the Qingzhou Army.",
    "Yuan Shu and Yuan Shao were at odds with each other. Shu sought aid from Gongsun Zan, who sent Liu Bei to station at Gaotang, Shan Jing to Pingyuan, and Tao Qian to Fagan, to pressure Yuan Shao. Cao Cao joined forces with Yuan Shao to attack them, and they defeated all of them.",
    "In the spring of the fourth year, Cao Cao's army was stationed at Juancheng. The Governor of Jing Province, Liu Biao, cut off Yuan Shu's supply lines. Shu led his army into Chenliu and stationed at Fengqiu, joined by remnants of the Black Mountain bandits and Yu Fuluo. Shu sent his general Liu Xiang to station at Kuangting. Cao Cao attacked Xiang, and when Shu came to his rescue, Cao Cao engaged him in battle and defeated him decisively. Shu retreated to defend Fengqiu, and Cao Cao besieged the city. Before the siege was complete, Shu fled to Xiangyi. Cao Cao pursued him to Taishou and diverted water to flood the city. Shu fled to Ningling, and Cao Cao continued the pursuit until Shu escaped to Jiujiang. In summer, Cao Cao returned his army to Dingtao.",
    "In Xiapi, Que Xuan gathered several thousand people and declared himself emperor. The Governor of Xu Province, Tao Qian, joined forces with him to capture Hua and Fei in Taishan and plunder Rencheng. In autumn, Cao Cao campaigned against Tao Qian, capturing more than ten cities. Qian defended his city and did not dare to come out.",
    "In that year, Sun Ce accepted Yuan Shu's commission to cross the Yangtze River, and within a few years, he took control of the lands east of the river.",
    "In the spring of the first year of Xingping (194 CE), Cao Cao returned from Xuzhou. Earlier, after Cao Cao's father Cao Song had retired from office and returned to Qiao County, the chaos caused by Dong Zhuo forced him to flee to Langya for safety, where he was killed by Tao Qian. This is why Cao Cao was determined to avenge his father by launching an eastern campaign.",
    "[According to the \"Shiyu\" (World Discourse): Cao Song was in Hua County of Taishan. Cao Cao ordered Ying Shao, the Governor of Taishan, to escort his family to Yanzhou. Before Ying Shao's troops arrived, Tao Qian secretly sent several thousand horsemen to capture them. Cao Song's family, thinking it was Ying Shao coming to escort them, were unprepared. When Tao Qian's soldiers arrived, they killed Cao Cao's brother Cao De at the gate. Frightened, Cao Song tried to escape through the back wall, helping his concubine out first. However, she was too plump and couldn't get through quickly. Cao Song fled to the privy, but both he and his concubine were killed, and everyone in the household perished. Fearing Cao Cao's retribution, Ying Shao abandoned his post and fled to Yuan Shao. By the time Cao Cao controlled Ji Province, Ying Shao had already died. Wei Zhao's \"Book of Wu\" states: When Cao Cao went to welcome his father, he sent over a hundred carts of belongings. Tao Qian dispatched Commander Zhang Kai with two hundred horsemen to escort them, but Zhang Kai killed Cao Song between Hua and Fei counties of Taishan, took all the valuables, and fled to Huainan. Cao Cao blamed Tao Qian for this, which is why he attacked him.]",
    "In summer, Cao Cao left Xun Yu and Cheng Yu to defend Juancheng, and again attacked Tao Qian, capturing five cities and extending his control to the Eastern Sea. On his return journey, he passed through Tan. Tao Qian's general Cao Bao and Liu Bei were stationed east of Tan to intercept Cao Cao. Cao Cao defeated them and subsequently attacked and captured Xiangben, causing much slaughter wherever he went.",
    "[Sun Sheng commented: \"To punish the guilty and relieve the people is the righteous path of the ancients. To blame Tao Qian but slaughter his subordinates was excessive.\"]",
    "Meanwhile, Zhang Miao and Chen Gong rebelled and welcomed Lü Bu, and the commanderies and counties all responded to their call. Xun Yu and Cheng Yu held Juancheng, while Fan and Dong'a counties remained loyal. Cao Cao then withdrew his army. When Lü Bu arrived, he attacked Juancheng but could not capture it, so he stationed his forces at Puyang. Cao Cao said, \"Lü Bu suddenly gained control of a province but failed to occupy Dongping and cut off the roads at Kangfu and Taishan to take advantage of the terrain against me. Instead, he camps at Puyang. I know he is incapable.\" So Cao Cao advanced to attack him. Lü Bu sent out his troops to fight, and his cavalry first attacked the Qingzhou troops. The Qingzhou troops fled, and Cao Cao's formation fell into disorder. As he raced through the flames, Cao Cao fell from his horse and burned his left palm. Officer Lou Yi helped Cao Cao back onto his horse, and they withdrew.",
    "[Yuan Wei's \"Chronicles of Emperor Xian\" states: When Cao Cao besieged Puyang, a prominent local family named Tian acted as spies, allowing Cao Cao to enter the city. He burned the east gate to show he had no intention of retreating. During the battle, his army was defeated. Lü Bu's cavalry captured Cao Cao without recognizing him and asked, \"Where is Cao Cao?\" Cao Cao replied, \"He is the one riding the yellow horse.\" So Lü Bu's cavalry released Cao Cao and chased after the rider on the yellow horse. The gate was still engulfed in flames, but Cao Cao charged through the fire and escaped.]",
    "Before reaching camp, none of the generals had met with Cao Cao and all were frightened. Cao Cao personally went to encourage the troops and ordered them to prepare siege equipment urgently. He advanced again to attack, and both sides were at a standoff for over a hundred days. Locusts appeared, and the people suffered great hunger. Lü Bu also ran out of food, and both sides withdrew.",
    "In the ninth month of autumn, Cao Cao returned to Juancheng. Lü Bu went to Chengshi but was defeated by a local named Li Jin, so he moved east to camp at Shanyang. At this time, Yuan Shao sent someone to persuade Cao Cao to form an alliance. Having just lost Yanzhou and with his army's provisions exhausted, Cao Cao was inclined to agree. However, Cheng Yu advised against it, and Cao Cao followed his advice. In the tenth month of winter, Cao Cao arrived at Dong'a.",
    "That year, a bushel of grain cost over 500,000 coins, and people resorted to cannibalism. Consequently, newly recruited officials and soldiers were dismissed. Tao Qian died, and Liu Bei succeeded him.",
    "In the spring of the second year (195 CE), Cao Cao took Dingtao by surprise. Wu Zi, the Governor of Jiyin, defended the southern city, which remained uncaptured. Then Lü Bu arrived, and they were defeated again. In summer, Lü Bu's generals Xue Lan and Li Feng camped at Juye. Cao Cao attacked them, and when Lü Bu came to rescue Lan, Lan was defeated, Lü Bu fled, and Cao Cao beheaded Lan and others. Lü Bu returned from Dongnei with Chen Gong, leading over ten thousand men to battle. At that time, Cao Cao had few troops, so he set an ambush and deployed light forces to attack, soundly defeating them.",
    "[According to the \"Book of Wei\": At that time, most of the soldiers were out harvesting wheat, and fewer than a thousand remained in the camp, which was not well fortified. Cao Cao ordered women to man the walls while he led all available troops to resist the enemy. To the west of the camp was a large embankment with dense trees to its south. Lü Bu suspected an ambush and said to his men, \"Cao Cao is full of tricks; don't fall into his trap.\" So he led his army to camp more than ten li to the south. The next day, he returned, and Cao Cao hid his troops behind the embankment, placing only half his forces in front of it. As Lü Bu advanced further, Cao Cao ordered light troops to provoke battle. Once engaged, the hidden troops all charged from the embankment, with infantry and cavalry advancing together. They crushed Lü Bu's forces, captured his dragon carriage, pursued them to their camp, and then returned.]",
    "Lü Bu fled that night, and Cao Cao attacked again, capturing Dingtao and dispatching troops to pacify various counties. Lü Bu fled east to Liu Bei. Zhang Miao followed Lü Bu but sent his brother Zhang Chao to defend Yongqiu with their family. In the eighth month of autumn, Cao Cao besieged Yongqiu. In the tenth month of winter, the Emperor appointed Cao Cao as Governor of Yanzhou. In the twelfth month, Yongqiu fell, and Zhang Chao committed suicide. Zhang Miao's clan was exterminated to the third generation. Zhang Miao had gone to Yuan Shu to request aid but was killed by his own troops. With Yanzhou pacified, Cao Cao then moved east to take Chen territory.",

    "Cao Cao planned to welcome the Emperor, though some of his generals had doubts. Encouraged by Xun Yu and Cheng Yu, he sent Cao Hong with troops to escort the Emperor westward. However, General of the Guards Dong Cheng and Yuan Shu's general Chan Nu blocked the way at strategic passes, preventing Cao Hong from advancing.",
    "In Runan and Yingchuan, Yellow Turban leaders He Yi, Liu Pi, Huang Shao, He Man, and others, each commanding tens of thousands of followers, had initially supported Yuan Shu but later allied with Sun Jian. In the second month, Cao Cao advanced to attack and defeat them, beheading Liu Pi, Huang Shao, and others, while He Yi and his followers surrendered. The Emperor appointed Cao Cao as General of Establishing Virtue. In the sixth month of summer, he was promoted to General Who Pacifies the East and enfeoffed as Marquis of Feiting. In the seventh month of autumn, Yang Feng and Han Xian escorted the Emperor back to Luoyang.",

    "Luoyang was in ruins, so Dong Zhao and others advised Cao Cao to establish the capital at Xu. In the ninth month, the imperial carriage departed through the Zhuanyuan Gate and headed east. The Emperor appointed Cao Cao as Grand General and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Wuping. Since the Emperor's flight westward, the court had been in constant turmoil, but from this time forward, the institutions of the ancestral temples and state altars were finally established.",
    "[Zhang Fan's \"Annals of Han\" states: Initially, when the Emperor was defeated at Caoyang, he wanted to float down the Yellow River. The Court Astronomer Wang Li said, \"Since last spring, Venus has encroached upon the Northern Dipper constellation, passed the Celestial Ford, and Mars has retrograded to guard the Northern River. These are inauspicious signs that should not be ignored.\" Because of this, the Emperor decided not to cross the river northward but planned to head east through Yigu Pass. Li also told the Imperial Clan Leader Liu Ai, \"Previously, Venus guarded the Celestial Gate and met with Mars; when metal and fire meet, it symbolizes a change of mandate. The Han dynasty is ending, and Jin and Wei will surely rise.\" Later, Li repeatedly told the Emperor, \"The Mandate of Heaven shifts, and the Five Elements do not remain ascendant forever. Earth succeeds Fire, Wei succeeds Han, and the Cao clan will bring peace to the world. The only option is to entrust matters to the Cao family.\" When Cao Cao heard this, he sent someone to tell Li, \"I know you are loyal to the court, but the ways of Heaven are profound and distant. Please refrain from saying too much.\"]",
    "When the Emperor was heading east, Yang Feng wanted to intercept him from Liang but failed to catch up. In the tenth month of winter, Cao Cao attacked Yang Feng, who fled south to Yuan Shu. Cao Cao then attacked and captured Feng's camp at Liang. At this time, Yuan Shao was appointed Grand Commandant, but he was ashamed to be ranked below Cao Cao and refused to accept the position. Cao Cao firmly declined his own appointment and yielded the position of Grand General to Yuan Shao. The Emperor then appointed Cao Cao as Minister of Works and acting General of Chariots and Cavalry. That year, following the advice of Zao Zhi, Han Hao, and others, Cao Cao began to establish military agricultural colonies.",
    "[According to the \"Book of Wei\": After years of chaos, grain was consistently scarce. Various armies rose up without provisions for the entire year—when hungry, they would plunder; when full, they would waste resources. Countless forces disintegrated and dispersed, defeating themselves without facing an enemy. When Yuan Shao was in Hebei, his soldiers relied on mulberries for food. When Yuan Shu was between the Yangtze and Huai rivers, he subsisted on water chestnuts and clams. People resorted to cannibalism, and the regions were desolate. Cao Cao said, \"The art of stabilizing a nation lies in strengthening the military and ensuring sufficient food. The Qin conquered the world by emphasizing agriculture, and Emperor Wu established military colonies to secure the Western Regions. These are excellent models from previous dynasties.\" That year, he recruited civilians to establish agricultural colonies around Xu, yielding one million bushels of grain. Subsequently, agricultural offices were established in various provinces and commanderies, accumulating grain reserves everywhere. When campaigning in the four directions, there was no burden of transporting provisions, allowing him to eliminate numerous rebels and pacify the realm.]",
    "Lü Bu attacked Liu Bei and captured Xiapi. Liu Bei came to seek refuge. Cheng Yu advised Cao Cao, \"I observe that Liu Bei has heroic talent and is greatly admired by the people.

Yuan Shu was angered and attacked Lü Bu but was defeated by him. In the ninth month of autumn, Yuan Shu invaded Chen, and Cao Cao marched east to counter him. Hearing that Cao Cao was coming personally, Yuan Shu abandoned his army and fled, leaving behind his generals Qiao Rui, Li Feng, Liang Gang, and Le Jiu. When Cao Cao arrived, he defeated Rui and the others, executing them all. Yuan Shu fled across the Huai River, and Cao Cao returned to Xu.",
    "After Cao Cao's withdrawal from Wuyin, various counties in Nanyang and Zhangling rebelled and sided with Zhang Xiu.

He wrote to Xun Yu: \"The enemy is pursuing me. Though we can only advance a few li each day, according to my strategy, once we reach Anzhong, Zhang Xiu will certainly be defeated.\" When they reached Anzhong, Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao's forces jointly defended the strategic passes, and Cao Cao's army faced enemies both front and rear. Cao Cao then ordered his men to excavate tunnels through the difficult terrain at night, allowing his baggage train to pass through, and set up an ambush. At dawn, the enemy thought Cao Cao was retreating and brought their entire force to pursue. Cao Cao then unleashed his hidden infantry and cavalry in a pincer attack, thoroughly defeating them.

How did you know?\" Cao Cao replied, \"The enemy blocked my retreating army and fought with me in a desperate situation. That is how I knew I would be victorious.\"",
    "Lü Bu again sent his general Gao Shun to attack Liu Bei on Yuan Shu's behalf. Cao Cao dispatched Xiahou Dun to assist Liu Bei, but he was unsuccessful. Liu Bei was defeated by Gao Shun. In the ninth month, Cao Cao launched an eastern campaign against Lü Bu. In the tenth month of winter, he sacked Pengcheng and captured Lü Bu's chancellor Hou Xie. Advancing to Xiapi, Lü Bu personally led his cavalry to counterattack. Cao Cao defeated them decisively, capturing Lü Bu's valiant general Cheng Lian. Pursuing them to the city walls, Lü Bu became frightened and wanted to surrender. Chen Gong and others dissuaded him from this plan and sought aid from Yuan Shu, encouraging Lü Bu to fight again. After another defeat, Lü Bu retreated to fortify his defenses, and Cao Cao's attacks failed to break through. At this time, Cao Cao's forces were exhausted from continuous battles, and he considered withdrawing. However, following the advice of Xun You and Guo Jia, he decided to divert the Si and Yi rivers to flood the city. After more than a month, Lü Bu's generals Song Xian, Wei Xu, and others captured Chen Gong and surrendered the entire city. Lü Bu and Chen Gong were taken alive and executed. Zang Ba, Sun Guan, Wu Dun, Yin Li, and Chang Pi of Taishan had each gathered their own forces. When Lü Bu defeated Liu Bei, these leaders had all joined Lü Bu.

Cao Cao released Bi Chen, saying, \"Your elderly mother is there; you may go.\" Bi Chen bowed his head, insisting he had no disloyal intentions, which moved Cao Cao to tears. After leaving, Bi Chen fled back to his family. When Lü Bu was defeated, Bi Chen was captured alive. Many feared for his safety, but Cao Cao said, \"A man who is filial to his parents, would he not also be loyal to his lord? This is what I seek.\" He appointed Bi Chen as Chancellor of Lu.",
    "[According to the \"Book of Wei\": Yuan Shao had long-standing grudges against former Grand Commandant Yang Biao, Chief of the Palace Secretariat Liang Shao, and Junior Minister Kong Rong, and wanted Cao Cao to execute them on other pretexts. Cao Cao said, \"Today, the empire is crumbling, heroes are rising everywhere, ministers and lords are all discontent, with each harboring their own ambitions. This is a time when those above and below distrust each other. Even treating people without suspicion, one fears they still lack confidence. If we were to eliminate someone, who would not feel endangered? Moreover, those who rise from common status, who live among the dust and dirt, and who are oppressed by ordinary people—how could their grievances not be overwhelming? Emperor Gaozu pardoned his enemy Yong Chi, and thereby reassured everyone. How could I forget this?\" Yuan Shao believed that Cao Cao outwardly espoused righteousness while inwardly fostering division, harboring deep resentment. I, Shen Songzhi, note that Yang Biao was later persecuted by Cao Cao and nearly died, while Kong Rong eventually could not escape execution. How could this be called practicing what one preaches? It's not difficult to know what's right, but to actually do it—that is the challenge, indeed!]",
    "In the second month of spring in the fourth year (199 CE), Cao Cao returned to Changyi. Zhang Yang's subordinate Yang Chou killed Zhang Yang, then Sui Gu killed Yang Chou and led his forces to join Yuan Shao, camping at Sheqian. In the fourth month of summer, Cao Cao advanced his army to the Yellow River and sent Shi Huan and Cao Ren across to attack them. Sui Gu left Xue Hong (Zhang Yang's former Chief Clerk) and Mou Shang (Governor of Henan) to defend the position while he personally led troops north to seek reinforcements from Yuan Shao. Sui Gu encountered Shi Huan and Cao Ren at Quancheng. In the ensuing battle, Sui Gu was decisively defeated and beheaded. Cao Cao then crossed the Yellow River and besieged Sheqian. Xue Hong and Mou Shang surrendered with their forces, were enfeoffed as marquises, and Cao Cao withdrew his army to Aocang. He appointed Wei Zhong as Governor of Henan and put him in charge of affairs north of the Yellow River.",

When Yanzhou rebelled, Cao Cao had said, \"Only Wei Zhong would not abandon me.\" When he heard that Wei Zhong had fled, Cao Cao angrily said, \"Even if Zhong doesn't flee south to Yue or north to the Hu barbarians, I won't let you escape!\" After capturing Sheqian, Wei Zhong was taken alive. Cao Cao said, \"I value his talent!\" He released Zhong from his bonds and employed him.",
    "At this time, Yuan Shao had already defeated Gongsun Zan and controlled four provinces with an army of over 100,000. He was planning to advance and attack Xu. Cao Cao's generals believed they could not oppose him, but Cao Cao said, \"I understand Yuan Shao's character. His ambition is great but his intelligence is limited. He appears fierce but is timid at heart. He is jealous of others' achievements and lacks authority. Though his troops are numerous, his command structure is unclear. His generals are arrogant, and his orders are inconsistent. Although his territory is vast and his provisions abundant, these will only end up serving me.\" In the eighth month of autumn, Cao Cao advanced his army to Liyang and sent Zang Ba and others to enter Qingzhou and defeat the forces in Qi, Beihai, and Dong'an. He left Yu Jin to camp along the river. In the ninth month, Cao Cao returned to Xu and divided his forces to defend Guandu. In the eleventh month of winter, Zhang Xiu led his forces to surrender and was enfeoffed as a marquis. In the twelfth month, Cao Cao stationed his army at Guandu.",
    "After Yuan Shu's defeat at Chen, his situation became increasingly difficult. Yuan Tan sent for him from Qingzhou. Yuan Shu intended to travel north from Xiapi, so Cao Cao dispatched Liu Bei and Zhu Ling to intercept him. However, Yuan Shu fell ill and died. When Cheng Yu and Guo Jia heard that Cao Cao had sent Liu Bei, they advised Cao Cao, \"Liu Bei should not be allowed to act freely.\" Cao Cao regretted his decision but could not catch up with Liu Bei. Before going east, Liu Bei had secretly conspired with Dong Cheng and others to rebel. Upon reaching Xiapi, he killed Che Zhou, the Inspector of Xuzhou, and raised an army at Pei. Cao Cao sent Liu Dai and Wang Zhong to attack him but they were unsuccessful.",

If Cao Cao comes personally, the outcome remains uncertain!\" The \"Tales of Cao Cao\" states: Liu Dai, styled Gongshan, was from Pei State. As Chief Clerk to the Minister of Works, he participated in campaigns and was enfeoffed as a marquis for his merits. The \"Wei Lüe\" states: Wang Zhong was from Fufeng. In his youth, he served as a village chief. During the chaos in the three adjuncts, Wang Zhong was so hungry that he resorted to cannibalism. He traveled south toward Wu Pass with his companions. They encountered Lou Zibotheir, who had been sent by the Governor of Jingzhou to welcome northern refugees. Wang Zhong did not wish to leave and led his group to attack Lou's forces, seizing their weapons. He gathered over a thousand men and joined Cao Cao, who appointed him as Palace Attendant and had him participate in military campaigns. When the palace officials learned that Wang Zhong had once engaged in cannibalism, they tied a skull from a grave to Wang Zhong's saddle during an imperial procession, making a joke of it.]",

    "In the first month of spring of the fifth year (200 CE), the conspiracy of Dong Cheng and others was exposed, and they were all executed. As Cao Cao was preparing to campaign east against Liu Bei, all his generals said, \"The one contesting the empire with you is Yuan Shao. If you abandon him to go east now while he is advancing, and he attacks from behind, what then?\" Cao Cao replied, \"Liu Bei is an outstanding talent. If we don't strike now, he will certainly become a future threat.",
    "[Sun Sheng's \"Spring and Autumn Annals of Wei\" states: In response to his generals, Cao Cao said, \"Liu Bei is a heroic talent and will become my concern if allowed to live.\" I, Shen Songzhi, believe that historical records often embellish speeches. What was recorded earlier may not be accurate, and later authors have further altered it with their own interpretations, distancing it even more from the truth. Sun Sheng's writings often replace original text with his own wording in the style of Zuo's Commentary, and this is not an isolated case. Alas, what can later scholars trust? Moreover, while Cao Cao was aspiring to rule the empire, to use the words of King Fuchai of Wu on the eve of his death seems especially inappropriate.]",
    "Although Yuan Shao has great ambitions, he is slow to act and will certainly not move.\" Guo Jia also encouraged Cao Cao, who then marched east to attack Liu Bei. He defeated Liu Bei and captured his general Xiahou Bao alive. Liu Bei fled to Yuan Shao, while Cao Cao captured Liu Bei's wife and children. Liu Bei's general Guan Yu was stationed at Xiapi, so Cao Cao advanced to attack him, and Guan Yu surrendered. Chang Pi rebelled in support of Liu Bei, but Cao Cao defeated him as well. Cao Cao then returned to Guandu, and Yuan Shao indeed did not move against him.",
    "In the second month, Yuan Shao sent Guo Tu, Chunyu Qiong, and Yan Liang to attack Liu Yan, the Grand Administrator of Dong commandery, at Baima. Yuan Shao led his army to Liyang, preparing to cross the Yellow River. In the fourth month of summer, Cao Cao went north to rescue Liu Yan. Xun You advised Cao Cao, \"Now our forces are few and cannot match the enemy directly. We must divide their strength. When you reach Yenjin, if you appear to be sending troops to cross the river and attack their rear, Yuan Shao will surely send forces west to respond. Then with light troops, we can raid Baima, taking them by surprise, and Yan Liang can be captured.\" Cao Cao followed this advice. When Yuan Shao heard that troops were crossing the river, he immediately divided his forces to respond to the west. Cao Cao then led his army rapidly toward Baima. When they were still more than ten li away, Yan Liang was greatly alarmed and came out to meet them in battle. Cao Cao sent Zhang Liao and Guan Yu to the front, and they defeated Yan Liang's forces, with Guan Yu killing Yan Liang. Cao Cao then lifted the siege of Baima, relocated its people, and proceeded west along the river. Yuan Shao crossed the river in pursuit of Cao Cao's army, reaching the south of Yenjin. Cao Cao arranged his troops in a camp at the foot of the southern slope and sent scouts to observe from a hill, who reported, \"There are five or six hundred horsemen.\" Shortly after, they reported again, \"The cavalry is increasing, and the infantry is countless.\" Cao Cao said, \"Do not report further.\" He then ordered his cavalry to unsaddle their horses and let them graze. At this time, the baggage train from Baima was on the road. The generals thought that since the enemy cavalry was numerous, they should return to defend the camp. Xun You said, \"This is precisely how we bait the enemy. How can we leave?\" Yuan Shao's cavalry commander Wen Chou and Liu Bei led five to six thousand horsemen, arriving in successive waves. The generals again reported, \"We should mount the horses.\" Cao Cao said, \"Not yet.\" After a while, more cavalry arrived, with some moving toward the baggage train. Cao Cao said, \"Now is the time.\" Everyone mounted their horses. At this point, Cao Cao had fewer than six hundred mounted troops, but he unleashed them in an attack, thoroughly defeating the enemy and killing both Wen Chou and Yan Liang. Wen Chou and Yan Liang were both renowned generals of Yuan Shao. After two battles, both were captured and killed, greatly shaking Yuan Shao's army. Cao Cao returned to Guandu, while Yuan Shao advanced to defend Yangwu. Guan Yu escaped and returned to Liu Bei.",
    "In August, Yuan Shao moved his interconnected camps forward, establishing them along sandy mounds stretching east-west for tens of li. Cao Cao also divided his forces to face them, but was unsuccessful in battle.",
    "[Xi Zuochi's \"Spring and Autumn Annals of Han and Jin\" states: Xu You advised Yuan Shao, \"You should not engage Cao Cao in direct combat. Urgently divide your forces to contain him while taking another route to welcome the Emperor. Then the matter will be resolved.\" Yuan Shao did not follow this advice, saying, \"I must first surround and capture him.\" Xu You was angered by this.]",
    "At this time, Cao Cao had fewer than ten thousand troops, with twelve to thirteen percent injured.",
    "[I, Shen Songzhi, believe that when Cao Cao first raised his army, he already had five thousand troops. After that, he won a hundred battles and was defeated only twelve or thirteen times. After defeating the Yellow Turbans alone, he accepted the surrender of over 300,000 soldiers, and the others he absorbed cannot all be recorded. Despite losses in battle, his forces could not have been so few. Fortified camps facing each other are different from decisive battles. The Basic Annals state: \"Yuan Shao had over 100,000 troops, with camps stretching tens of li east to west.\" Although Cao Cao was exceptionally talented in military strategy, how could he have resisted for so long with just a few thousand troops? Reasoning through this, I believe this account is incorrect. First, if Yuan Shao's camps stretched tens of li and Cao Cao could establish camps to face them, his forces could not have been very few. Second, if Yuan Shao had ten times the troops, he should have completely surrounded Cao Cao and cut off all movement, yet Cao Cao sent Xu Huang to attack their supply wagons, and he personally went out to attack Chunyu Qiong and others, moving his banners back and forth without obstruction, showing that Yuan Shao could not contain him—another indication that Cao Cao's forces were not very few. Third, various texts state that Cao Cao buried 70,000 or 80,000 of Yuan Shao's troops. Eight thousand men could not have bound 80,000 fleeing soldiers, and Yuan Shao's large army would not have surrendered without resistance if they significantly outnumbered Cao Cao—a third indication that Cao Cao's forces were not very few. The recorder likely exaggerated the disparity to make the victory seem more extraordinary, rather than recording facts accurately. According to \"Zhong Yao's Biography,\" \"When Cao Cao was in a standoff with Yuan Shao, Yao was the Colonel Director of Retainers and sent over 2,000 horses to supply the army.\" Both the Basic Annals and the \"Shiyu\" state that Cao Cao had only 600 horses at that time—so where did Zhong Yao's horses go?]",
    "Yuan Shao advanced to Guandu again, building earthen mounds and tunnels. Cao Cao also constructed similar defenses inside his camp to counter them. Yuan Shao shot arrows into Cao Cao's camp, with arrows falling like rain, forcing everyone to move under shields, and greatly frightening the troops. At this time, Cao Cao's provisions were low, and he wrote to Xun Yu, discussing the possibility of returning to Xu. Xun Yu replied, \"Yuan Shao has gathered all his forces at Guandu, intending to decide victory or defeat with you. If you, with your minimal strength, face his maximum power and cannot overcome him, he will certainly take advantage of this. This is the great turning point of the empire. Moreover, Yuan Shao is merely a commoner hero who can gather people but cannot use them effectively. With your divine military prowess and clear wisdom, supported by the great righteousness, what could you not accomplish?\" Cao Cao followed his advice.",
    "Sun Ce, hearing that Cao Cao and Yuan Shao were engaged in a standoff, planned to raid Xu but was killed by an assassin before he could set out.",
    "The rebels from Runan led by Liu Pi rebelled and allied with Yuan Shao, capturing Xu territory. Shao sent Liu Bei to assist Pi, but Lord Cao dispatched Cao Ren who defeated them. Bei fled, and Pi's forces were routed.",
    "Yuan Shao sent several thousand grain wagons, but Lord Cao used Xun You's strategy, dispatching Xu Huang and Shi Huan to intercept them. They achieved a great victory, burning all the wagons. Lord Cao and Shao remained in a standoff for months. Although Cao's forces killed enemy generals in several skirmishes, his smaller army was running low on supplies and his troops were exhausted. Cao told his supply officers, \"In fifteen days I will defeat Shao, and you will no longer have to labor so hard.\"",
    "In winter, during the tenth month, Shao sent wagons of grain with Chunyu Qiong and four others commanding over 10,000 troops as escort, camping forty li north of Shao's camp. Shao's strategist Xu You, greedy for wealth that Shao couldn't satisfy, defected to Cao and suggested attacking Qiong's forces. Though Cao's advisors were suspicious, Xun You and Jia Xu encouraged the plan. Lord Cao left Cao Hong to guard the camp and personally led 5,000 infantry and cavalry in a night march, arriving at dawn. When Qiong's forces saw how few troops Cao had, they came out to fight. Cao attacked fiercely, forcing Qiong back to his camp, then laid siege. Shao sent cavalry to rescue Qiong. Some advisors said, \"The enemy cavalry is approaching, we should divide our forces to resist them.\" Cao angrily replied, \"The enemy is behind us, of course!\" His troops fought desperately and achieved a great victory, executing Qiong and his commanders.",
    "[According to the \"Biography of Cao Man\": When Lord Cao heard of Xu You's arrival, he ran out barefoot to greet him, clapping his hands and laughing, \"With your arrival from afar, my affairs will succeed!\" Once seated, You asked, \"Yuan's army is powerful, how will you counter them? How much grain do you have?\" Cao said, \"Enough for a year.\" You replied, \"That's not true, speak honestly!\" Cao then said, \"Enough for half a year.\" You said, \"If you truly wish to defeat Yuan, why not be truthful?\" Cao answered, \"I was joking earlier. In reality, we have only enough for one month. What can be done?\" You said, \"You're isolated with an army, without external support and your supplies are exhausted—this is a critical situation. Yuan has over 10,000 supply wagons at Gushi and Wuchao, poorly guarded. If you strike them with light troops, achieving surprise, and burn their supplies, within three days Yuan's forces will collapse.\" Cao was delighted and selected elite infantry and cavalry, using Yuan's military banners. They gagged their horses and took side roads by night, each soldier carrying bundles of firewood. When questioned on the road, they replied, \"Lord Yuan fears Cao Cao might raid our rear forces, so he sent us to strengthen defenses.\" People believed this and remained unconcerned. Upon arrival, they surrounded the supply camp, set fires, and caused chaos. They completely defeated the camp, burning all the grain and treasure, beheading commanders Sui Yuanjin, Han Juzi, Lü Weihuang, Zhao Rui and others. They cut off General Chunyu Zhongjian's nose but didn't kill him, slaughtered over a thousand soldiers, cutting off their noses, and cut the lips and tongues of cattle and horses to display to Shao's army, terrifying his officers and men. That night, when someone captured Zhongjian and brought him to Cao, Cao asked, \"Why are you in this state?\" Zhongjian replied, \"Victory or defeat is heaven's will, why bother asking?\" Cao considered sparing him, but Xu You said, \"Tomorrow he will see himself in a mirror, and he will never forget what happened.\" So Cao had him executed.]",
    "When Yuan Shao first heard that Cao was attacking Qiong, he told his eldest son Tan, \"While he attacks Qiong, I'll capture his camp, leaving him nowhere to return!\" He sent Zhang He and Gao Lan to attack Cao Hong. When He and Lan heard about Qiong's defeat, they surrendered to Cao. Shao's forces collapsed completely, and Shao fled with Tan across the Yellow River. Cao pursued but couldn't catch them, capturing all their equipment, documents, treasures, and troops.",
    "[According to the \"Daily Records of Emperor Xian\": Lord Cao reported: \"The Grand General and Marquis of Ye, Yuan Shao, previously conspired with the Governor of Ji Province, Han Fu, to support the former Grand Marshal Liu Yu, forging a golden seal and sending the former magistrate Bi Yu to Yu, explaining reasons for the mandate. Shao also wrote to me saying: 'You can establish a capital at Juancheng, and someone should be installed there.' He made unauthorized gold and silver seals, and appointed officials who all went to serve him. His cousin, the Governor of Jiyin, Yuan Xu, wrote to him: 'Now the realm is in chaos, and Heaven's intent is truly with our family. Divine omens show it should be with you, elder brother. Your southern brother's subordinates wished him to claim the throne, but your southern brother said that by age the northern brother is older, and by rank the northern brother holds higher position. He wanted to send the imperial seal, but Cao Cao cut off the road.' Shao's clan has received great favor from the state for generations, yet they show such treachery and wickedness. I marshaled troops to fight him at Guandu, and with the majesty of the sacred court, beheaded Shao's general Chunyu Qiong and seven others, achieving a great victory. Shao fled with his son Tan. In total, over 70,000 heads were taken, along with equipment and wealth in the millions.\"]",
    "Lord Cao collected letters in Shao's camp from people in Xu and in his own army, but burned them all.",
    "[According to the \"Wei Dynasty Spring and Autumn Annals\": Lord Cao said, \"When Shao was at his strongest, I could barely protect myself, let alone others!\"]",
    "Many commanderies and cities in Ji Province surrendered to Cao.",
    "Earlier, during Emperor Huan's reign, a yellow star had appeared in the region of Chu and Song. Yin Kui of Liaodong, skilled in astronomy, predicted that fifty years later a true hero would arise between Liang and Pei whose power would be unstoppable. Now fifty years had passed, and Lord Cao had defeated Shao, becoming unrivaled in the realm.",
    "In summer of the sixth year, in the fourth month, Cao mobilized troops along the Yellow River and attacked Shao's forces at Cangtingzhen, defeating them. Shao retreated, regathered his scattered troops, and recaptured various rebellious commanderies and counties. In the ninth month, Lord Cao returned to Xu. Before Shao was defeated, he had sent Liu Bei to capture Runan, where the bandits Gong Du and others supported him. Cao sent Cai Yang to attack Du but was defeated. Lord Cao then personally led a southern expedition against Bei. When Bei heard Cao was coming personally, he fled to Liu Biao, and Du's forces scattered.",
    "In spring of the seventh year, during the first month, Lord Cao stationed at Qiao and issued an edict: \"I raised righteous troops to eliminate violence and chaos for the realm. The people of my native land have been largely wiped out. Walking through the country all day, I see no familiar faces, which fills me with sorrow. For those who joined my righteous cause and died without descendants, seek their relatives to continue their lineage, grant them superior land, provide them with plowing oxen, and establish schools to educate them. Build temples for the survivors to worship their ancestors. If spirits have consciousness, what regrets would I have after a hundred years?\" He then went to Junyi, repaired the Suiyang Canal, and sent an envoy with grand sacrificial offerings to honor Qiao Xuan.",
    "[The \"Edict of Rewards and Honors\" records Cao's sacrificial text: \"The former Grand Commandant, Lord Qiao, displayed brilliant virtue and extensive benevolence. The state recalls his bright teachings, and scholars think of his excellent counsel. Though his spirit is hidden and his body concealed, how distant he has gone! In my youth, I was fortunate to meet him, and despite my ignorant and unrefined nature, this great gentleman accepted me. My glory and prestige all came from his encouragement, just as Confucius said he could not match Yan Hui, and Li Sheng deeply praised Jia Fu. When a scholar dies knowing someone appreciated him, this is never forgotten. I also recall his casual promise: 'After my death, if you pass by and fail to pour even a single cup of wine or offer a chicken, don't be surprised if your stomach aches after passing three steps!' Though this was just a playful jest, how could anyone but the dearest friend say such words? I don't believe spirits can inflict illness, but remembering old times makes me melancholy. Carrying out eastern expeditions, camping in familiar territory, looking north toward your noble land, my heart turns to your tomb. I present this modest offering; may you receive it!\"] Cao then advanced his army to Guandu.",
    "After his army's defeat, Yuan Shao fell ill, vomiting blood, and died in the fifth month of summer. His younger son Shang succeeded him, while Tan declared himself General of Chariots and Cavalry, and camped at Liyang. In autumn, during the ninth month, Lord Cao campaigned against them, fighting a series of battles. Tan and Shang were repeatedly defeated and withdrew to defend their fortifications.",
    "In spring of the eighth year, during the third month, Cao attacked their outer defenses. They came out to fight but were badly defeated, with Tan and Shang fleeing by night. In the fourth month of summer, Cao advanced his army to Ye. In the fifth month, he returned to Xu, leaving Jia Xin to garrison Liyang.",
    "On the day Yi-you, he issued an edict: \"According to the 'Art of War,' 'a general dies advancing,' [The 'Wei Records' explain: advancing means moving forward; advance one foot but never retreat one inch.] This is why Zhao Kuo's mother begged that her son not be punished. In ancient times, when a general was defeated in the field, his family was punished at home. Since I took command of expeditions, I have rewarded success but not punished failure, which is contrary to national tradition. Henceforth, generals on expedition who lose battles will be held criminally responsible, and those who fail to achieve victory will lose their official ranks and noble titles.\"",
    "[The \"Wei Records\" record that on the day Geng-shen, an edict stated: \"Some argue that military officers, though capable and meritorious, lack the moral character to be selected as governors of commanderies and states—this is what they call 'able to follow the Way but not to exercise authority.' Guan Zhong said: 'When worthy men feed on ability, the ruler is respected; when fighters feed on merit, soldiers take death lightly; when these two principles are established in the state, the realm is well-governed.' I have never heard of incompetent men and non-combatants receiving salaries and rewards yet still being able to establish merit and benefit the state. Therefore, enlightened rulers do not appoint ministers without merit, nor reward soldiers who don't fight; in peaceful times they value moral conduct, in times of crisis they reward capability. The critics' view is like viewing a tiger through a tube!\"]",
    "In autumn, during the seventh month, Cao issued an edict: \"Since the time of chaos began fifteen years ago, those born in recent years have not witnessed the customs of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and deference, which I deeply regret. Order each commandery and state to promote education and learning, and establish schools in counties with five hundred or more households. Select the talented youths of the district to teach them, in hopes that the Way of the ancient kings will not be abandoned and will benefit the realm.\"",
    "In the eighth month, Lord Cao campaigned against Liu Biao, stationing his army at Xiping. After Cao left Ye and headed south, Tan and Shang fought over Ji Province. Tan was defeated by Shang and retreated to defend Pingyuan. As Shang pressed the attack, Tan sent Xin Pi to surrender and request aid. Many generals were suspicious, but Xun You encouraged Cao to accept, [The \"Wei Records\" state: Lord Cao said, \"When I attacked Lü Bu, Biao did not cause trouble; during the battle at Guandu, he did not assist Yuan Shao. He is a bandit who merely defends himself and should be dealt with later. Tan and Shang are cunning, so we should take advantage of their conflict. Even if Tan is deceitful and doesn't ultimately submit, if I can defeat Shang and take all their territory, the benefits will be great.\" So he accepted the proposal.] so Lord Cao turned his army back. In winter, during the tenth month, he arrived at Liyang and arranged a marriage between his son Zheng and Tan's family. [Commentary by Chen Songzhi: From Shao's death until this point, only five months had passed. Tan, though born after his brother, did not observe three years of mourning for Shao, but held marriage celebrations within less than two years—this was wrong. Lord Cao of Wei may have made this arrangement as a temporary expedient; saying \"arranged a marriage\" doesn't necessarily mean the ceremony was performed that year.]",
    "When Shang heard Cao was coming north, he abandoned the siege of Pingyuan and returned to Ye. Lü Kuang and Lü Xiang of Dongping rebelled against Shang, stationed at Yangping, and surrendered their forces to Cao, who enfeoffed them as marquises. [The \"Wei Records\" state: After Tan's siege was lifted, he secretly gave a general's seal to Kuang. Kuang accepted the seal and sent it to Lord Cao. Cao said, \"I knew Tan had a small scheme. He wants me to attack Shang so he can gather forces in the meantime. Once Shang is defeated, he thinks he can become strong enough to take advantage of our weakness. But after Shang is defeated, we will be at our strongest—what weakness would there be to exploit?\"]",
    "In spring of the ninth year, during the first month, Lord Cao crossed the Yellow River and diverted the Qi River into the Baiqu Canal to open a supply route. In the second month, Shang again attacked Tan, leaving Su You and Shen Pei to defend Ye. Cao advanced his army to the Huan River, and You surrendered. Upon arrival, Cao besieged Ye, building earth mounds and tunnels. Yin Kai, the Magistrate of Wu'an, garrisoned Maocheng to secure supply lines from Shangdang. In summer, during the fourth month, Cao left Cao Hong to continue the siege of Ye while personally leading forces to attack Kai, defeating him before returning. Shang's general Ju E defended Handan, [Ju is pronounced \"ju.\" This surname still exists in the region north of the Yellow River. E was Ju Shou's son.] which Cao also captured. Han Fan, the Magistrate of Yiyang, and Liang Qi, the Chief of She, surrendered their counties, and were granted the title of Marquis within the Passes. In the fifth month, Cao demolished the earth mounds and tunnels, constructed encircling fortifications, and diverted the Zhang River to flood the city; more than half the people in the city starved to death.",
    "In autumn, during the seventh month, Shang returned to rescue Ye. All the generals suggested, \"This is a returning army fighting for survival—we should avoid them.\" Cao said, \"If Shang comes by the main road, we should avoid him; but if he comes along the western mountains, he will be trapped.\" Shang indeed came along the western mountains, establishing a camp by the Fu River. [The \"Biography of Cao Man\" states: He sent several scouting parties to confirm this, all reporting, \"He's definitely taking the western route, already at Handan.\" Cao was delighted and gathered his generals, saying, \"I have already secured Ji Province—do you know how?\" All replied, \"We don't know.\" Cao said, \"You will see before long.\"]",
    "That night, Shang sent troops to attack the siege lines, but Cao counterattacked and defeated them, then surrounded their camp. Before they could engage fully, Shang became afraid. Former Provincial Governor of Yu Province Yin Kui and Chen Lin asked to surrender, but Cao refused, tightening the siege. Shang fled by night to secure Qishan, but Cao pursued and attacked him. His generals Ma Yan and Zhang Yi surrendered in the midst of battle, causing a complete rout, and Shang fled to Zhongshan. Cao captured all their equipment, including Shang's seal, ribbon of office, and battle-axe, then sent Shang's surrendered men to show these to his family in the city, causing demoralization. In the eighth month, Shen Pei's nephew Rong opened the east gate that he was guarding and let Cao's troops in. Pei fought against them but was defeated and captured alive, then executed. Ye was pacified.",
    "Lord Cao personally visited Yuan Shao's tomb to make sacrifices, weeping tears. He consoled Shao's wife, returned family treasures, and granted them silk, cotton, and food provisions. [Sun Sheng commented: The ancient kings established punishments and rewards to discourage evil and encourage good, creating eternal examples. Shao, during national crisis, harbored treasonous ambitions, discussing usurping the imperial throne and violating national institutions. Destroying ancestral shrines of traitors was ancient practice. Yet Cao fully mourned at a rebel's tomb and showed kindness to a greedy family—this was a stumbling point in his governance. Hiding enmity toward friends was something wise men of old were ashamed of, and tears shed at former residences should not be insincere. If moral principles diverge and friendship ends, what is there to mourn? Emperor Gaozu of Han made this error with the Xiang clan, and Lord Cao of Wei followed this mistaken precedent—this must be counted among his rare errors.]",
    "Earlier, when Yuan Shao and Lord Cao first raised troops together, Shao asked Cao, \"If affairs do not go well, what strategic position would you occupy?\" Cao replied, \"What do you think?\" Shao said, \"I would control the Yellow River in the south, rely on Yan and Dai in the north, incorporate the forces of the northern tribes, and face south to contest the realm—perhaps this would succeed?\" Cao said, \"I would rely on the wisdom and strength of the realm, governing through principles—nothing would be impossible.\" [The \"Book of Fu Zi\" records: Lord Cao also said, \"Kings Tang and Wu achieved rule differently. If one relies on terrain and fortifications, one cannot respond to circumstances and adapt.\"]",
    "In the ninth month, Cao issued an edict: \"The people north of the Yellow River have suffered under Yuan Shao's tyranny. Let them be exempt from taxes and tribute for this year!\" He also strengthened laws against powerful families seizing land, bringing joy to the common people. [The \"Wei Records\" preserve Lord Cao's edict: \"For those who govern states and families, the concern is not too few people but unequal distribution; not poverty but instability. Under Yuan Shao's rule, the powerful acted without restraint, with relatives accumulating vast properties. The common people were impoverished, paying rents and taxes, selling family possessions yet still unable to meet demands. Shen Pei's clan even hid criminals and harbored fugitives. How could they expect the people's support and military strength? The land tax shall be four sheng per mu, each household shall provide two bolts of silk and two jin of cotton, with no other demands. The governors and ministers of commanderies and states shall inspect carefully, ensuring that powerful families do not hide assets while the weak bear double burdens.\"] The Emperor appointed Lord Cao as Governor of Ji Province, but Cao declined and returned to Yan Province.",
    "While Cao was besieging Ye, Tan had seized Ganling, Anping, Bohai, and Hejian. After Shang's defeat, he returned to Zhongshan. Tan attacked him there, forcing Shang to flee to Gu'an, then incorporated his forces. Lord Cao sent Tan a letter, accusing him of breaking his agreement, severing the marriage alliance, and returning the bride before advancing his army. Tan became afraid, abandoned Pingyuan, and retreated to defend Nanpi. In the twelfth month, Cao entered Pingyuan and pacified various counties.",
    "In spring of the tenth year, during the first month, Lord Cao attacked Yuan Tan, defeated him, beheaded him, and executed his wife and children, thus pacifying Ji Province. [The \"Wei Records\" state: When Lord Cao attacked Tan, the battle remained undecided from dawn until midday; Cao then personally took up the war drums, which inspired all his soldiers to fight with renewed vigor, and they immediately broke through the enemy lines.]",
    "Cao issued an edict: \"Those who shared in the evil deeds of the Yuan clan shall be given a fresh start.\" He ordered that people could no longer pursue private vendettas, prohibited extravagant burials, and established uniform laws. That same month, Yuan Xi's generals Jiao Chu, Zhang Nan, and others rebelled and attacked Xi and Shang, who fled to the Wuhuan tribes of the Three Commanderies. Chu and the others surrendered their counties and were enfeoffed as marquises.",
    "When first campaigning against Tan, some people fled rather than break the ice [Chen Songzhi's commentary: When campaigning against Tan, the rivers and canals were frozen, and people were ordered to break the ice to allow boats to pass. Finding the labor too difficult, some fled]. The law stated that those who fled should not be permitted to surrender. Shortly after, when one of these fugitives appeared at his gate, Lord Cao told him: \"If I accept you, I violate my order; if I kill you, I punish honesty. Return and hide yourself well, don't let officials capture you.\" The man left weeping; later he was indeed captured.",
    "In summer, during the fourth month, the Black Mountain bandit Zhang Yan surrendered with his force of over 100,000 men and was enfeoffed as a marquis. In Gu'an, Zhao Du, Huo Nu, and others killed the Provincial Inspector of You Province and the Governor of Zhuo Commandery. The Wuhuan of the Three Commanderies attacked Xianyu Fu at Kuangping. [The \"Continued Han Records' Gazetteer of Commanderies and States\" says: Kuangping was a county under Yuyang Commandery.]",
    "In autumn, during the eighth month, Lord Cao campaigned against them, executed Du and his accomplices, then crossed the Lu River to rescue Kuangping. The Wuhuan fled beyond the frontier.",
    "In the ninth month, Cao issued an edict: \"Forming cliques and factions was detested by the ancient sages. I hear that in Ji Province, it is customary for fathers and sons to be in different factions, maligning each other. In the past, Zhi Buyi had no elder brother, yet people accused him of stealing his sister-in-law; Diwu Boyu married three orphaned girls, yet was accused of beating his father-in-law; when Wang Feng wielded power, Gu Yong compared him to Shen Bo; when Wang Shang offered loyal counsel, Zhang Kuang called it heresy. These are all cases of calling white black, deceiving Heaven and misleading the ruler. I wish to rectify customs and morals—if these four types of behavior aren't eliminated, I would be ashamed.\" In winter, during the tenth month, Lord Cao returned to Ye.",
    "Earlier, Yuan Shao had appointed his nephew Gao Gan as Governor of Bing Province. When Cao captured Ye, Gan surrendered and was made Provincial Inspector. When Gan heard that Cao was campaigning against the Wuhuan, he rebelled, captured the Governor of Shangdang, and mobilized troops to defend Huguan Pass. Cao sent Yue Jin and Li Dian to attack him, and Gan retreated to defend Huguan city.",
    "In spring of the eleventh year, during the first month, Lord Cao campaigned against Gan. When Gan heard of this, he left a subordinate general to defend the city and fled to the Xiongnu, seeking aid from the Chanyu, who refused him. Cao besieged Huguan for three months before capturing it. Gan then fled to Jing Province, where Wang Yan, the Chief of Shangluo, captured and beheaded him.",
    "In autumn, during the eighth month, Lord Cao led an eastern expedition against the pirate Guan Cheng. Reaching Chunyu, he dispatched Yue Jin and Li Dian, who defeated Cheng, forcing him to flee to an island. Cao then annexed Xiangben, Tan, and Qi counties from Donghai to Langya, and abolished Changlu Commandery. [The \"Wei Records\" preserve an edict issued on the day Yi-hai of the tenth month: \"In governing the world and leading the people, establishing assistants and advisors, the danger lies in superficial compliance. The Book of Poetry says, 'Listen to my counsel, and you will have no great regrets'—this is the sincere desire between ruler and minister. Bearing a heavy responsibility, I constantly fear failing to achieve balance. For several years now, I have not heard excellent counsel—perhaps this is my fault for not seeking it earnestly? From now on, all my assistants, office managers, and deputies shall, on the first day of each month, each report my shortcomings, which I will review.\"]",
    "The Wuhuan of the Three Commanderies took advantage of the chaos in the realm to destroy You Province and capture some hundred thousand Han households. Yuan Shao had established their chieftains as Chanyus and given them his family members as wives, claiming they were his daughters. The Chanyu of Liaoxi, Tadun, was particularly powerful and favored by Shao, which is why the Yuan brothers had fled to him, and he frequently raided across the frontier. As Lord Cao prepared to campaign against him, he dug canals—from the Hutuo River into the Gu River [Gu is pronounced \"gu\"], naming it the Pinglu Canal; and from the Juhe mouth [Ju is pronounced \"ju\"] into the Lu River, naming it the Quanzhou Canal—to create a route to the sea.",
    "In spring of the twelfth year, during the second month, Lord Cao returned from Chunyu to Ye. On the day Ding-chou, he issued an edict: \"I raised righteous troops to punish violence and chaos, and it has now been nineteen years. Every campaign has been victorious—but is this my achievement? It is due to the efforts of worthy scholars and officials. Though the realm is not yet fully pacified, I should join with worthy men to complete the task. How could I exclusively enjoy the rewards? Expedite the establishment of ranks and enfeoffments based on merit.\" Thereupon, he generously enfeoffed over twenty meritorious ministers as marquises, with others receiving ranks according to their contributions, and also making provisions for the orphans of those who died in service, with different levels based on their merits.",
    "[The \"Wei Records\" preserve Lord Cao's edict: \"In ancient times, when Zhao She and Dou Ying served as generals, they received gifts of a thousand gold pieces and immediately distributed them, thus they were able to achieve great merit and leave a lasting reputation. Whenever I read about them, I can't help but admire their character. In military campaigns with generals, officials, and scholars, I've been fortunate that worthy men haven't withheld their counsel, and everyone has given their full effort, enabling us to overcome obstacles and quell disorder. Thus I have received great rewards, with domains of 30,000 households. Recalling Dou Ying's principle of distributing gold, I am now dividing my received rents with the generals, officials, and those who previously garrisoned Chen and Cai, hoping to repay everyone's efforts rather than selfishly enjoying great benefits. Make appropriate provisions for the orphans of those who died in service through grain allocations. If the years are prosperous and resources sufficient, with rents fully collected, I will share everything extensively with everyone.\"]",
    "As he prepared to campaign north against the Wuhuan of the Three Commanderies, all his generals said: \"Yuan Shang is just a fugitive. The barbarians are greedy and have no true loyalties—how could they be loyal to Shang? If we advance deeply to attack them, Liu Bei will surely persuade Liu Biao to attack Xu. If there is any trouble, it will be too late for regrets.\" Only Guo Jia argued that Biao wouldn't trust Bei, and urged Cao to proceed.",
    "In summer, during the fifth month, Cao reached Wuzhong. In autumn, during the seventh month, there were great floods, making the coastal road impassable. Tian Chou offered to serve as a local guide, which Cao accepted. He led the army out through the Lulong Pass, beyond which the road ended and was impassable. Cao then had trenches dug and valleys filled for over 500 li, passing through Baitan and Pinggang, traversing the Xianbei territories, and heading east toward Liucheng. When they were still 200 li away, the barbarians learned of their approach. Shang, Xi, Tadun, the Liaoxi Chanyu Lou Ban, the Youbeiping Chanyu Neng Chendi, and others, led several tens of thousands of cavalry to intercept the army.",
    "In the eighth month, as they ascended White Wolf Mountain, they suddenly encountered the enemy in great force. Cao's supply train was far behind, and he had few armored soldiers, causing great alarm among his attendants. Cao climbed to a high point, observed that the enemy formation was disorganized, and immediately ordered an attack, with Zhang Liao as the vanguard. The barbarian force collapsed completely. Tadun and several chieftains were beheaded, and over 200,000 Hu and Han people surrendered. The Liaodong Chanyu Supuwan and various chieftains from Liaoxi and Beiping abandoned their people and fled with Shang and Xi to Liaodong, still having several thousand cavalry.",
    "Earlier, Gongsun Kang, the Governor of Liaodong, had been too distant to submit. After Cao defeated the Wuhuan, some advised him to continue the campaign against Kang, saying that the Yuan brothers could be captured. Cao replied, \"I will make Kang send me the heads of Shang and Xi—no military action will be needed.\" In the ninth month, Cao withdrew his army from Liucheng. [The \"Biography of Cao Man\" states: At that time it was cold and dry, with no water for two hundred li. The army also lacked food and had to slaughter several thousand horses for provisions. They had to dig more than thirty zhang into the ground to find water. After successfully withdrawing, Cao asked for those who had advised against the campaign. Everyone was afraid, not knowing his intentions. However, Cao rewarded them generously, saying, \"When I went forward, I was taking a risk for potential gain. Though successful, it was due to Heaven's aid and should not become standard practice. Your advice was the safest course, which is why I reward you—do not hesitate to speak in the future.\"]",
    "Kang indeed beheaded Shang, Xi, and Supuwan, and sent their heads to Cao. Some generals asked, \"How did you know that after your withdrawal, Kang would kill Shang and Xi?\" Cao replied, \"He had always feared them. If I pressed him, they would join forces; if I withdrew, they would plot against each other—this was inevitable.\"",
    "In the eleventh month, Cao reached the Yi River. Pufulou, the Acting Chanyu of the Wuhuan of Dai Commandery, and Nalou, the Acting Chanyu of the Wuhuan of Shang Commandery, brought their chieftains to pay homage.",
    "In spring of the thirteenth year, during the first month, Lord Cao returned to Ye and constructed the Xuanwu Pool to train naval forces. [Yi means \"to practice.\" According to the \"Three Cangjie\": \"Yi means to practice.\"] The Han Emperor abolished the Three Ducal Ministers and established the positions of Chancellor and Imperial Censor. In summer, during the sixth month, Lord Cao was appointed Chancellor. [The \"Daily Records of Emperor Xian\" state: The Emperor sent the Grand Ceremonial Officer Xu Qiu to confer the seal of office. The Imperial Censor no longer supervised the Palace Secretaries, and a Chief Clerk was established. The \"Biographies of Worthy Predecessors\" state: Qiu, style name Mengping, was from Guangling. From youth he was pure and honest, standing as a principled official at court. He served as Governor of Rencheng, Runan, and Donghai commanderies, bringing good governance wherever he went. When summoned to return, he was detained by Yuan Shu. When Shu usurped the imperial title and wanted to appoint him to high office, Qiu refused to submit. After Shu's death, Qiu obtained Shu's seal and presented it to the Han court, being appointed Commandant of the Guards and then Grand Ceremonial Officer. When Lord Cao became Chancellor, he offered the position to Qiu.]",
    "In autumn, during the seventh month, Lord Cao led a southern expedition against Liu Biao. In the eighth month, Biao died, and his son Cong succeeded him, stationing at Xiangyang, while Liu Bei stationed at Fan. In the ninth month, Cao arrived at Xinye, and Cong immediately surrendered. Bei fled to Xiakou. Cao advanced his army to Jiangling and issued an edict to the officials and people of Jing Province, promising them a fresh start. He then assessed the merits of those who had submitted in Jing Province, enfeoffing fifteen people as marquises, appointing Liu Biao's general Wen Pin as Governor of Jiangxia, allowing him to command his original troops, and recruiting the famous scholars of Jing Province like Han Song and Deng Yi.",

By Emperor Ling's time, many people were skilled in calligraphy, with Shi Yiguan being the best. He was very proud of his ability and would burn his practice sheets after writing. Liang Hu would offer him wine and wait until he was drunk to steal his writing samples. Hu eventually became Minister of Personnel due to his calligraphic skills. When Lord Cao wanted to appoint someone as Magistrate of Luoyang, Hu recommended himself as North District Captain. Hu later served under Liu Biao. After Jing Province was pacified, Cao sought Hu, who in fear bound himself and came to Cao's gate, identifying himself as a Military Assistant Secretary. Cao assigned him to the Imperial Library, where he proved himself through diligent writing. Cao would hang his works in his tent or nail them to the wall to admire, saying they surpassed Yiguan. Hu's style name was Menghuang, and he was from Anding. The inscriptions on Wei palaces and buildings were all written by Hu.]",
    "[Huangfu Mi's \"Biographies of Recluses\" states: Wang Jun of Runan, style name Ziwen, was recognized in his youth by Fan Pang and Xu Zhang, and was close to Cen Yi of Nanyang. When Lord Cao was still a commoner, he particularly appreciated Jun, who also praised Cao as having the capacity to govern the world. When Yuan Shao and his brother Shu lost their mother and returned to bury her in Runan, Jun and Cao met them there, along with 30,000 others. Cao privately told Jun, \"The realm will soon fall into chaos, and the leaders of that chaos will surely be these two men. To save the realm and plead for the common people, if these two are not eliminated first, chaos will arise now.\" Jun replied, \"If what you say is true, who but you could save the realm?\" They looked at each other and laughed. Jun was outwardly calm but inwardly perceptive, and refused appointments from provinces and the Three Offices. When summoned by imperial carriage, he didn't go but retreated to Wuling, where over a hundred families followed him. When the Emperor moved the capital to Xu, Jun was again summoned to be a Palace Attendant but didn't accept. When Liu Biao saw Yuan Shao's power growing, he secretly communicated with Shao. Jun told Biao, \"Lord Cao is the hero of the realm and will surely establish the hegemonic way, continuing the achievements of Dukes Huan and Wen. Now you abandon what is near to seek what is far—if there is a sudden crisis, how can you expect help from across the northern deserts?\" Biao didn't listen. Jun died of old age at sixty-four in Wuling, and Cao mourned deeply upon hearing the news. After pacifying Jing Province, Cao personally went to the Yangtze to receive his remains, reburying him at Jiangling and honoring him as a worthy predecessor.]",
    "The Governor of Yi Province, Liu Zhang, began accepting imperial requisitions and sent troops to supply the army. In the twelfth month, Sun Quan, in support of Liu Bei, attacked Hefei. Lord Cao departed from Jiangling to campaign against Bei, reaching Bazhou and sending Zhang Xi to relieve Hefei. When Quan heard of Xi's arrival, he withdrew. Cao reached Chibi and engaged Bei in battle but was unsuccessful. A great epidemic broke out, with many officials and soldiers dying, so he withdrew his army. Bei thus gained control of Jing Province and the commanderies south of the Yangtze.",
    "[The \"Records of the Lord of Shanyang\" state: Bei burned Cao's ships, so Cao had to withdraw his army along the Huarong Road on foot. They encountered mud and impassable terrain, with strong winds. Cao ordered the weak soldiers to carry bundles of grass to fill the road, allowing the cavalry to pass. Many weak soldiers were trampled by men and horses, sinking into the mud and dying in great numbers. After the army escaped, Cao was delighted. When his generals asked why, he said, \"Liu Bei is my equal, but his strategy came a little late. Had he set the fires earlier, all my men would have perished.\" Bei did eventually set fires but too late to have effect.]",
    "[Sun Sheng's Evaluation of Differences states: According to the \"Records of Wu,\" Liu Bei first defeated Cao's army, after which Quan attacked Hefei, but this account states that Quan first attacked Hefei, followed by the battle at Chibi. The two accounts differ, with the \"Records of Wu\" being correct.]",
    "In spring of the fourteenth year, during the third month, the army reached Qiao, where Cao built light boats and trained naval forces. In autumn, during the seventh month, he entered the Huai River from the Wo River, emerged into the Fei River, and encamped at Hefei. On the day Xin-wei, he issued an edict: \"For some time now, the army has been on numerous campaigns, sometimes encountering epidemics. Officials and soldiers have died without returning home, leaving their families grieving and the common people displaced—how could a benevolent person take pleasure in this? It was unavoidable. For the families of the deceased who have no property and cannot support themselves, the government shall not cut off their allowances. Local officials shall care for and comfort them, in accordance with my wishes.\" He appointed officials for the commanderies and counties of Yang Province and opened the Shaopo fields for military agriculture. In the twelfth month, the army returned to Qiao.",
    "In spring of the fifteenth year, Cao issued an edict: \"Since ancient times, emperors who received the Mandate or achieved restoration—have they not always had worthy men and gentlemen to help them govern the realm? And when they found such worthy men, they need not look beyond villages and lanes—was this mere coincidence? It was because those in high positions sought them out. Now the realm is not yet pacified, and this is especially an urgent time to seek talent. 'Meng Gongchuo would be excellent as an elder for Zhao or Wei, but not as a minister of Teng or Xue.' If only pure men could be employed, how could Duke Huan of Qi have achieved hegemony! Are there not in the world today those wearing coarse clothes but carrying jade, fishing on the banks of the Wei River? Are there not those who stole their sister-in-law and accepted gold, but have not yet met their Wuzhi? You ministers should help me identify and promote obscure talents. Recommend people based solely on ability, and I will employ them.\" In winter, he built the Bronze Sparrow Terrace.",
    "[The \"Anecdotes of Wei Wu\" record that in the twelfth month, on the day Ji-hai, Lord Cao issued an edict: \"When I was first nominated as Filial and Incorrupt, I was young and knew I was not a famous scholar from the mountains and valleys. Fearing the people of the realm would see me as ordinary and foolish, I wished to become governor of a commandery, implement good policies, and establish a reputation that would make scholars recognize me. Thus, in Jinan, I began by eliminating corruption and selecting officials impartially, defying the regular palace attendants. This angered the powerful, and fearing it would bring disaster to my family, I retired due to illness. After leaving office, I was still young—looking at others of my age, even those fifty years old weren't considered old. I thought to myself: twenty years from now, when the realm is at peace, I will be equal to those of my age who are just beginning their careers. So I returned to my hometown four times a year and built a retreat fifty li east of Qiao, intending to read in autumn and summer, and hunt in winter and spring. I sought a low-lying area to conceal myself with mud and water, cutting off visitors' expectations, but couldn't achieve this wish.",
    "Later, I was summoned as a Captain and promoted to Colonel Director of Retainers. My ambition then changed to wanting to defeat rebels for the state, hoping to be enfeoffed as a marquis and made General Who Conquers the West, so that my tombstone would read 'Tomb of Marquis Cao, Former General Who Conquers the West of Han'—this was my aspiration. Then came Dong Zhuo's crisis, and I raised righteous troops. At that time, I could have gathered many soldiers, but I deliberately limited their numbers. This was because with many troops comes great ambition, leading to conflict with powerful enemies and potentially causing greater disasters. At the Battle of Bian River, I had only a few thousand men; later, returning to Yang Province to recruit more, I still limited myself to three thousand—this shows my original intentions were modest.",
    "Later, I governed Yan Province and defeated and incorporated 300,000 Yellow Turban troops. Then Yuan Shu usurped the imperial title in Jiujiang, with everyone calling him emperor. He named his gate the Gate of Establishing the Title, dressed in imperial robes, and his two wives competed to become empress. His plans were set, and when someone urged him to immediately assume the imperial throne and announce it to the realm, he replied, 'Cao Gong is still around, it's not yet possible.' Later, I captured his four generals and their troops, causing Shu to become isolated and ruined, falling ill and dying.",
    "When Yuan Shao controlled the north of the Yellow River with powerful forces, I judged that I truly couldn't match him. I merely planned to die for the country, sacrificing myself for righteousness, which would be enough to set an example for later generations. Fortunately, I defeated Shao and executed his two sons. Liu Biao, considering himself of imperial lineage, harbored treacherous thoughts, advancing and retreating to observe developments, and controlling his province. I pacified him too, thus stabilizing the realm. As Chancellor, I have reached the highest position a subject can attain, exceeding my expectations. In saying this, I may seem boastful, but I want to speak fully, holding nothing back. If the state did not have me, I wonder how many would have claimed to be emperor or king. Perhaps people see my power and strength, and knowing that by nature I don't believe in fate, they may privately judge me as having disloyal ambitions, making baseless assumptions, which often troubles me.",
    "The reason Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin are praised to this day is that despite their vast military power, they still served the Zhou royal house. The Analects say, 'With two-thirds of the realm, they served the Yin Dynasty—the virtue of Zhou can truly be called supreme virtue,' meaning they used greatness to serve the small. When Yue Yi fled to Zhao, the King of Zhao wanted him to plot against Yan, but Yue Yi prostrated himself and wept, saying, 'I served King Zhao as I would serve Your Majesty. If I were found guilty and banished to another state, I would accept it for life, but I could not bear to plot against Zhao's subjects, let alone the descendants of Yan!' When Emperor Er Shi killed Meng Tian, Tian said, 'From my ancestors to my descendants, we have faithfully served Qin for three generations. Now I command more than 300,000 troops, enough to rebel, but knowing I must die yet upholding righteousness, I dare not disgrace my ancestors' teachings or forget the former king.' Whenever I read about these two men, I can't help but shed tears.",
    "From my grandfather to myself, we have all held positions of trust and importance. We can be said to have been trusted, extending to my son Huan and his brothers—more than three generations. I don't just say this to you all; I often tell my wives and concubines, making them deeply understand my intentions. I tell them, 'After I am gone for thousands of years, you will all remarry. I want you to pass on my heart, making others know it.' These words come from the depths of my being. The reason I so earnestly express my innermost feelings is that I see Duke Zhou wrote the 'Metal-Bound Coffer' to clarify himself, fearing people wouldn't believe him.",
    "However, asking me to simply relinquish my command of troops and return to my position, becoming Marquis of Wuping, is truly impossible. Why? Because I genuinely fear that once separated from my troops, I would be harmed. I must consider both my descendants and the fact that if I fall, the state would be endangered. Thus, I cannot pursue an empty name while facing real disaster—this is what cannot be done. Recently, the court graciously enfeoffed my three sons as marquises, which I firmly declined. Now I wish to accept these titles, not for prestige, but as external support, planning for complete security. I have heard of Jie Zitui avoiding Jin's enfeoffment and Shen Shushi fleeing Chu's rewards, and have never read about them without sighing, reflecting on myself. Carrying the state's prestige, wielding battle-axes in campaigns, using the weak to defeat the strong, using the small to capture the large—whatever I plan succeeds, whatever I consider prospers, thus pacifying the realm without disgracing the imperial mandate. This can be called Heaven aiding the House of Han, not human effort. Yet I am enfeoffed with four counties and 30,000 households—what virtue merits this? The rivers and lakes are not yet calm, so I cannot yield my position; but as for territory, that can be declined. Now I return to the throne Yangxia, Zhe, and Ku—three counties with 20,000 households—keeping only Wuping's 10,000 households, both to reduce criticism and lessen my responsibility.\"]",
    "In spring of the sixteenth year, during the first month, [The \"Wei Records\" state: On the day Geng-chen, the Emperor replied: He reduced Cao's fiefs by 5,000 households and used the 15,000 households from the three counties Cao had returned to enfeoff his three sons: Zhi as Marquis of Pingyuan, Ju as Marquis of Fanyang, and Bao as Marquis of Raoyang, each with 5,000 households.] the Emperor appointed Lord Cao's heir-apparent Pi as Palace Attendant of the Five Offices, establishing official positions for him to serve as the Chancellor's deputy. Shang Yao and others rebelled at Daling in Taiyuan, so Cao sent Xiahou Yuan and Xu Huang to surround and defeat them. Zhang Lu controlled Hanzhong, and in the third month, Cao sent Zhong Yao to attack him. Cao ordered Yuan and others to depart from Hedong to join Yao.",
    "At this time, the various generals west of the pass were suspicious that Cao Zhang wanted to attack them, so Ma Chao along with Han Sui, Yang Qiu, Li Kan, and Cheng Yi rebelled. Cao Cao sent Cao Ren to suppress them. Ma Chao and the others stationed their troops at Tong Pass. Cao Cao instructed his generals: \"The western troops are valiant and strong. Fortify your positions and do not engage them in battle.\"",
    "In the seventh month of autumn, Cao Cao personally led a western expedition. [According to the \"Book of Wei\": The advisors often said, \"The western troops are strong and skilled with long spears. Without elite vanguard troops, we cannot face them.\" Cao Cao told his generals, \"Battle is in our control, not the enemy's. Though they are skilled with long spears, I will make it so they cannot use them to stab. You gentlemen just watch.\" The armies then encamped on opposite sides of Tong Pass.]",
    "Cao Cao kept them under pressure while secretly sending Xu Huang, Zhu Ling, and others to cross the Puban Ford at night and establish a camp on the western bank of the Yellow River. Cao Cao himself crossed north of Tong Pass. Before he completed the crossing, Ma Chao rushed to attack his boats fiercely. Colonel Ding Fei deliberately released cattle and horses as bait for the enemy. When the enemy troops scattered to capture the animals, Cao Cao was able to complete the crossing.",
    "[According to \"The Biography of Cao Man\": When Cao Cao was about to cross the river, just as the vanguard had crossed, Ma Chao and his forces suddenly arrived. Cao Cao remained seated on his camp bed without moving. Zhang He and others, seeing the urgency of the situation, together pulled Cao Cao into a boat. The river current was swift, and they drifted four or five li northward while Ma Chao's cavalry pursued and shot arrows at them like rain. The generals, seeing the army defeated and not knowing Cao Cao's whereabouts, were all anxious. When they finally saw him, they were both sad and happy, some even weeping. Cao Cao laughed heartily and said, \"Today I was nearly trapped by these small bandits!\"]",
    "Cao Cao then moved south along the river, building a walled path. The enemy retreated and took up positions at the mouth of the Wei River. Cao Cao set up many decoy troops while secretly loading soldiers onto boats to enter the Wei River. He built a floating bridge and, at night, divided his forces to establish camps south of the Wei. The enemy attacked the camps at night but were defeated by Cao Cao's ambush forces.",
    "Ma Chao and his allies encamped south of the Wei River and sent messengers requesting peace, asking for territory west of the Yellow River. Cao Cao refused. In the ninth month, he advanced his army across the Wei River.",
    "[According to \"The Biography of Cao Man\": Whenever Cao Cao's army tried to cross the Wei River, they were repeatedly charged by Ma Chao's cavalry and could not establish a camp. The ground was also very sandy and unsuitable for building ramparts. Lou Zibo suggested to Cao Cao: \"Now that the weather is cold, we can build walls with sand and pour water over them. They will freeze solid overnight.\" Cao Cao followed this advice. He had many silk bags made to transport water, crossed the river with troops at night to build the walls, and by morning, the walls were established. Thus, Cao Cao's entire army was able to cross the Wei River. Some doubt that in the ninth month the water would freeze. I, Pei Songzhi, have examined the \"Book of Wei\": Cao Cao's army reached Tong Pass in the eighth month and crossed north of the Yellow River in the intercalary month, which was an intercalary eighth month that year. By this time, it could indeed be very cold!]",
    "Ma Chao and his allies repeatedly challenged Cao Cao to battle, but he refused. They persistently requested land and asked that hostages be sent. Cao Cao, following Jia Xu's plan, pretended to agree. Han Sui asked to meet with Cao Cao personally. Since Cao Cao and Han Sui's father had been recommended as \"Filial and Incorrupt\" candidates in the same year, and Cao Cao and Han Sui were contemporaries, they met on horseback and talked for a long time, not discussing military matters but only reminiscing about old times in the capital, patting each other's hands and laughing joyfully. After the meeting, Ma Chao and the others asked Han Sui, \"What did Cao Cao say?\" Han Sui replied, \"Nothing of importance.\" This made Ma Chao and the others suspicious.",
    "[According to the \"Book of Wei\": The next day, Cao Cao met with Han Sui again. His generals said, \"When you meet with the enemy, you should not be too casual. We should make wooden barriers for the horses as protection.\" Cao Cao agreed. When the enemy generals saw Cao Cao, they all bowed while on horseback. The Qin and Hu people gathered in large numbers to observe, crowding before and behind. Cao Cao laughed and said to the enemy, \"Do you wish to see Cao Cao? I am but a normal person, without four eyes or two mouths—I simply have more wisdom!\" The Hu people came in large numbers to observe. Cao Cao also arranged 5,000 iron cavalry in ten lines of formation, their armor gleaming in the sun, which further intimidated the enemy.]",
    "Another day, Cao Cao sent Han Sui a letter with many corrections and edits, as if Han Sui had revised it himself. This made Ma Chao and the others even more suspicious of Han Sui. Cao Cao then set a date for battle. He first sent light troops to engage them, and after fighting for a good while, he unleashed his Tiger Cavalry to attack from both sides, thoroughly defeating them and killing Cheng Yi, Li Kan, and others. Han Sui and Ma Chao fled to Liang Province, Yang Qiu fled to Anding, and the lands west of the pass were pacified.",
    "Some generals asked Cao Cao: \"Initially, when the enemy held Tong Pass and the northern route along the Wei River was cut off, why did you not attack Pingyi from Hedong but instead held position at Tong Pass, taking many days before crossing to the north?\" Cao Cao replied: \"When the enemy held Tong Pass, if I had entered Hedong, the enemy would certainly have withdrawn to defend the various river crossings, making the western river impossible to cross. Therefore, I concentrated my forces toward Tong Pass. When the enemy gathered their forces to defend in the south, the defense of the western river was weakened, allowing my two generals to take control of it. Then I led my army to cross in the north, and the enemy could not contest the western river with me because of my two generals' forces there. I connected wagons and planted stakes to form a walled path southward, not only making us invulnerable but also appearing weak. After crossing the Wei River, I built strong fortifications and did not engage when the enemy came, which made them arrogant. Thus, the enemy did not build fortifications and asked for territory. I pretended to agree, following their wishes and making them complacent and unprepared. Meanwhile, I preserved my troops' strength, and when I finally struck, it was like thunder that gives no time to cover one's ears. The variations of military strategy cannot be limited to one approach.\"",
    "Initially, whenever an enemy contingent arrived, Cao Cao showed signs of joy. After the enemy was defeated, his generals asked him why. Cao Cao answered: \"The lands west of the pass are vast. If the enemy had each relied on strategic locations, it would have taken one or two years to subdue them. Now that they have all gathered together, though their numbers are great, they do not submit to unified leadership, and their army has no proper commander. They can be eliminated in one strike, making the achievement relatively easy. That is why I was pleased.\"",
    "In the tenth month of winter, the army marched north from Chang'an to attack Yang Qiu, besieging Anding. Yang Qiu surrendered, and his rank was restored. He was instructed to remain and comfort the local people. [According to \"Wei Lüe,\" during the Huangchu era, Yang Qiu was promoted to General Who Conquers Bandits, with the rank of Special Advanced, and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Linjing. He died of natural causes. In the twelfth month, Cao Cao returned from Anding, leaving Xiahou Yuan to garrison Chang'an.]",
    "In the first month of spring in the seventeenth year, Cao Cao returned to Ye. The Emperor ordered that Cao Cao need not bow when presenting memorials, need not use his personal name in documents, need not walk quickly when entering court, and could wear a sword and shoes when ascending the imperial hall—following the precedent set for Xiao He. Ma Chao's remaining followers, led by Liang Xing and others, garrisoned Lantian. Xiahou Yuan was sent to defeat them. The counties of Dangyin, Zhaoge, and Linlu in Henan, the counties of Weiguo, Dunqiu, Dongwuyang, and Fa'gan in Dongyang, the counties of Guantao, Quzhou, and Nanhe in Juye, the county of Rencheng in Guangping, and the counties of Xiangguo, Handan, and Yiyang in Zhao were all separated from their original commanderies and added to Wei Commandery.",
    "In the tenth month of winter, Cao Cao campaigned against Sun Quan.",
    "In the first month of spring of the eighteenth year, he advanced his army to Ruxu, attacked and broke Sun Quan's camp west of the Yangtze, captured Sun Quan's commander Gongsun Yang, and then withdrew his army. An imperial edict reorganized the fourteen provinces back into nine provinces. In the fourth month of summer, Cao Cao returned to Ye.",
    "On the day of Bingsheng in the fifth month, the Emperor sent the Imperial Censor Chi Lu to present a ceremonial document appointing Cao Cao as Duke of Wei. [According to the \"Continued Book of Han\": Lu's courtesy name was Hongyu, and he was from Gaoping in Shanyang.] In his youth, he studied under Zheng Xuan, and in the early Jian'an years, he served as Palace Attendant. [According to Yu Pu's \"Records of the Regions South of the Yangtze\": The Emperor once granted a special audience to Lu and the Minister of the Imperial Treasury Kong Rong. He asked Kong Rong, \"What are Hongyu's particular strengths?\" Kong Rong replied, \"He can be trusted to follow the proper way, but not to exercise authority.\" Lu raised his tablet and said, \"When Kong Rong previously governed Beihai, his governance was lax and the people scattered. Where was his authority then?\" They continued to criticize each other's strengths and weaknesses, leading to discord. Cao Cao reconciled them through a letter. Lu was transferred from Minister of Ceremonies to Imperial Censor.]",
    "The edict read:",
    "\"Due to my lack of virtue, I suffered misfortune at a young age, was moved to the western lands, and relocated to Tang and Wei. At that time, I was like a hanging ornament, the ancestral temples lacked sacrifices, and the state altars had no position. Various evildoers coveted power and divided the lands of Xia. I could not gain the support of the people of the realm, and the mandate of my imperial ancestors was about to fall to the ground. I rose early and retired late, with trembling and fear in my heart, saying, 'Of my ancestors and fathers, of the arms and legs of the state, and of the previous righteous ministers, who can care for my person?' Heaven then guided and nurtured the Chancellor, who protected and assisted our imperial family and saved us from difficulties. I truly relied on him. Now I will bestow upon you the symbols of rank and ritual; respectfully listen to my command.",
    "\"In the past, when Dong Zhuo first caused national calamity, various marquises surrendered their positions to plan for the imperial house. You then took action, first raising military forces. This demonstrates your loyalty to the court. Later, when the Yellow Turbans rebelled against the natural order and invaded our three provinces, extending to innocent civilians, you again eliminated them and pacified the eastern lands. This is another of your achievements. When Han Xian and Yang Feng monopolized authority and commands, you launched an attack, successfully removing the difficulty, then moved the capital to Xu, created our imperial precincts, established officials, and performed sacrifices, not losing the old artifacts. Thus, Heaven, Earth, ghosts, and spirits were properly served. This is another of your achievements. Yuan Shu usurped authority and acted rebelliously in Huainan. Afraid of your spiritual power, he sought extraordinary plans. In the Qiyang campaign, Qiao Rui surrendered his head. Your imposing might advanced south, and Yuan Shu consequently collapsed. This is another of your achievements. Turning your spears east, you executed Lü Bu. When returning your chariot, Zhang Yang died, Sui Gu submitted to punishment, and Zhang Xiu surrendered. This is another of your achievements. Yuan Shao rebelled against the natural order and plotted to endanger the state altars. Relying on his large numbers, he raised troops and insulted the interior. At that time, the imperial army was few and weak, and the hearts of people throughout the empire were cold, with none having firm resolve. You maintained the great principle, your spirit penetrated to the bright sun, you aroused your martial anger, and employed your divine strategy. You reached Guandu and greatly destroyed the ugly types, allowing our state to be rescued from dangerous collapse. This is another of your achievements. You led troops across the great Yellow River, pacified and established four provinces. Yuan Tan and Gao Gan both had their heads displayed, pirates fled and scattered, and the Black Mountain bandits followed the proper path. This is another of your achievements. The three tribes of the Wuhuan caused chaos for two generations. Yuan Shang relied on them and forcibly occupied the northern frontier. With tied horses and suspended chariots, you eliminated them in a single campaign. This is another of your achievements. Liu Biao was disloyal and did not supply tribute. The imperial army took to the road, and your awesome reputation preceded you. A hundred cities and eight commanderies surrendered with folded arms and bent knees. This is another of your achievements. Ma Chao and Cheng Yi, united in evil, occupied the banks of the Yellow River and Tong Pass, seeking to satisfy their desires. You annihilated them south of the Wei River, presented tens of thousands of severed ears, then pacified the border regions and comforted the various non-Chinese peoples. This is another of your achievements. The Xianbei and Dingling came from great distances through multiple translations, and the peoples of Beidi and Baixi requested officials and fulfilled their duties. This is another of your achievements. You have the achievement of pacifying the empire, augmented by brilliant virtue. You have regulated the empire, promoted beautiful customs, extended diligent instruction, and been careful with criminal punishments. The officials have no harsh governance, and the people harbor no evil. You have honored the imperial clan and continued extinct lineages. There are no old virtues or previous achievements that have not been properly rewarded. Even though Yi Yin conformed to august Heaven, and the Duke of Zhou illuminated the four seas, compared to you, they are nothing.",
    "\"I have heard that the ancient kings established brilliant virtue, bestowed land upon ministers, divided the people among them, elevated their honors, and provided them with ritual objects. This was to protect the royal house and assist their generations. During the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, when Guan and Cai were not peaceful, recalling the difficulties and considering the achievements, the king had Shao Kang Gong grant land to Qi Taigong extending east to the sea, west to the Yellow River, south to Muling, and north to Wudi. Five marquises and nine earls were permitted to be attacked by him. The ancestral sacrifice of the Grand Preceptor was established to mark the Eastern Sea. By the time of King Xiang, there were also Chu people who did not fulfill royal duties. He commanded Duke Wen of Jin to become a feudal lord, bestowing upon him two chariots, tiger warriors, axes and halberds, black millet wine, and bows and arrows. He greatly opened the Southern Yang and became a permanent covenant lord. The fact that the Zhou house did not collapse was due to the assistance of these two states. Now, you have demonstrated brilliant virtue, clearly protected my person, responded to the Heavenly Mandate, and promoted great achievements. You have comforted the nine regions, and there are none who do not follow your lead. Your achievements surpass those of Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou, yet your rewards are inferior to those of Qi and Jin. I am deeply ashamed of this.",
    "\"With my insignificant person, I am entrusted above the multitude of people. I constantly contemplate the difficulties, as if treading on thin ice over an abyss.

I bestow upon you the black soil, wrapped in white thatch. I inscribe this on your turtle shell to establish your great altar. In the past, during the Zhou house, Duke Bi and Duke Mao entered to serve as high ministers, while Zhou and Shao became tutors and protectors and went out to become the two Earls.

I therefore bestow upon you the Embroidered Robe and Cap, with red shoes to accompany them. Because you value humility and modesty, causing the people to rise up and act, with the young and old observing propriety, and harmony between high and low, I therefore bestow upon you suspended bells music and dances of six rows. Because you assist in spreading moral transformation, extending to the four directions, causing distant people to change their appearance and the Chinese regions to be fully populated, I therefore bestow upon you red doors for your residence. Because you cultivate your enlightened wisdom and consider what is difficult for the emperor, appoint the talented and employ the worthy, and promote all good things, I therefore bestow upon you steps for ascending. Because you hold the balance of the state, maintain proper demeanor, and suppress even the slightest evil, I therefore bestow upon you three hundred tiger warriors. Because you carefully enforce Heaven's punishments and clearly identify those who are guilty, with none who violate the laws escaping execution, I therefore bestow upon you one axe and one halberd. Because you are like a soaring dragon and a tiger's gaze, looking to the eight directions, attacking and discussing rebelliousness, and repelling attacks from the four seas, I therefore bestow upon you one red bow, one hundred red arrows, ten black bows, and one thousand black arrows.

You executed the rebellious usurpers Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu, eliminated the Yellow Turban rebel types, exterminated the chief rebels, and cleared away the weeds. You have endured frost and dew for over twenty years. Since the beginning of written records, there has been no achievement like this.",
    "\"In the past, the Duke of Zhou continued the legacy of Kings Wen and Wu, receiving an already established enterprise. Resting upon ink and brush, he embraced the various lords. The toil of Shang and Yan did not exceed two years. Lü Wang relied on the situation of possessing two-thirds of the empire and the power of eight hundred feudal lords. He temporarily held the banner and halbert, directing with a wave of the hand. Yet both of them greatly expanded their territories, spanning provinces and states. The Duke of Zhou's eight sons all became feudal lords. White and red sacrificial animals were used to sacrifice to Heaven and Earth. Their classic documents and objects were comparable to the royal house, with glory and favor as magnificent as this.",
    "\"By the time of the rise of the Han, among ministers who assisted in establishing the mandate, Zhang Er and Wu Rui had very minimal achievements, yet they connected cities, opened lands, and faced south as lords. These were all cases of enlightened rulers and perceptive masters acting above, and worthy ministers and sage assistants receiving below, according to the excellent institutions of the Three Dynasties and the clear system of the Han emperors. Now, comparing labor with Zhou and Lü, they were leisurely. Calculating merit with Zhang and Wu, theirs were slight. Discussing the system with Qi and Lu, it was important. Speaking of territory with Changsha, it was much. Therefore, the enfeoffment of the state of Wei and the honor of the Nine Bestowments, compared to previous rewards, are still like wearing jade wrapped in coarse cloth.",
    "\"Moreover, the various marquises and generals, fortunate to cling to the dragon and thoroughbred, have managed to steal small merits, wearing purple and carrying yellow, numbering in the hundreds. They will also transmit this for ten thousand generations. Yet Your Excellency alone declines rewards from above, causing those below to feel uncomfortable. This goes against the joyful heart of the sacred court above and the sincere hope of all officials below. You forget the great enterprise of assisting and supporting and believe in the petty conduct of common people. This is what we greatly fear.\" Thereupon, Cao Cao ordered an external memorial, accepting only Wei Commandery.",
    "Xun You and others again said: \"We observe that when the state of Wei was first established, the sacred court gave careful consideration, consulted with various officials, and then issued the mandate. Yet Your Excellency has long defied the imperial intention and not accepted the great ritual. Now that you have respectfully received the imperial command and fulfilled the hopes of all, you again wish to decline much and accept little, rejecting nine and receiving one. This is as if the rewards of the Han court are not implemented, and our request is not granted. In the past, the enfeoffments of Qi and Lu encompassed the Eastern Sea, with territories and populations of four million households. With such a broad foundation and extensive enterprise, it was easy to establish merit. Thus, they were able to achieve the service of supporting and the accomplishment of bringing order.",
    "\"Now, although the state of Wei has the name of ten commanderies, it is still less than Qufu. Calculating its households, it cannot reach half. As a protective fence for the royal house, establishing walls and screens, it is still not enough. Moreover, the sacred emperor, observing the disaster of Qin lacking assistants and the difficulties of the recent turbulent times, entrusts the establishment of loyalty and wisdom and restores what has fallen. We wish Your Excellency to respectfully accept the imperial command and not refuse.\" Cao Cao then accepted the appointment.",
    "[According to \"Wei Lüe,\" Cao Cao submitted a memorial of gratitude, saying: \"I received the great favor of the former emperor, attaining the position of Gentleman of the Yellow Gate. By nature, I am lazy and tired, and my aspirations were already fulfilled. I did not dare to hope for high position but only wished to be somewhat distinguished. When Dong Zhuo caused chaos, it was right to face death and difficulty. Therefore, I dared to raise myself and issue commands, breaking through the enemy and leading the masses. Then I encountered a rare opportunity in a thousand years and served directly under Your Majesty. During the time when the two Yuans were raging and encroaching, Your Majesty and I were of one heart in anxiety and concern. Looking toward the capital, advancing to face fierce enemies, I constantly feared that ruler and minister would both fall into the tiger's mouth. Truly, I did not expect to preserve my life and limbs. Relying on the spiritual aid of the imperial ancestors, the evil types were exterminated, allowing this humble minister to steal a name among them.]",
    "\"Your Majesty bestowed favor, appointing me as Chancellor, with enfeoffment, rank, salary, and emoluments, rich, great, and generous. In my life's wishes, I truly did not hope for this. Speaking with my heart, I was fortunate to await punishment, preserve my rank as a marquis, and pass it on to my descendants, entrusting myself to a sacred age and forever without worry or responsibility. Unexpectedly, Your Majesty has issued a magnificent intention, establishing a state and providing all the bestowments to reward this foolish minister, with territory comparable to Qi and Lu, and rituals equal to a vassal king. This is not what I, without merit, should receive. I have expressed my feelings above but have not been granted a hearing. The stern edict is urgent, truly causing my heart to be constrained. Reflecting on myself, I am listed among the great ministers, commanded to regulate the royal house. My body is not my own; how dare I be selfish and follow my foolish intentions, even to the point of retreating and returning to my initial service? Now I receive territory to strengthen the border defenses. I do not dare to look far ahead, considering future generations. As for father and son swearing for a lifetime, reducing my body to ashes and exhausting my life to repay the thick grace, with imperial majesty before me, I tremblingly accept the edict.\"",

In the eleventh month, the positions of Imperial Secretary, Palace Attendant, and Six Ministers were first established.",

Zhao Qu of Nan'an and Yin Feng of Hanyang attacked Ma Chao, decapitated his wife and children, causing Ma Chao to flee to Hanzhong. Han Sui relocated to Jincheng and entered the territory of the Di King Qianwan's tribe. Han Sui led over ten thousand Qiang and Hu cavalry against Xiahou Yuan in battle. They engaged in combat, and Xiahou Yuan's forces were utterly defeated, causing him to retreat to Xiping. Later, Xiahou Yuan and various generals attacked Xingguo and completely slaughtered the population. The provinces of Andong and Yongyang were abolished.",
    "When Gongqiu Xing was about to assume his post as Governor of Anding, Cao Cao warned him: \"If the Qiang and Hu tribes wish to establish relations with the Middle Kingdom, they should send their own envoys to us—you must never send people to them first. Good people are difficult to find, and they will likely instruct the Qiang and Hu tribes to make unreasonable demands, seeking personal gain. If you refuse, you risk alienating foreign peoples; if you agree, there will be no benefit.\" After Xing arrived at his post, he sent Colonel Fan Ling to the Qiang territory. As Cao Cao had predicted, Fan Ling indeed instructed the Qiang to request the establishment of a Dependent State Command. Cao Cao remarked: \"I foresaw this would happen—not because I am a sage, but because I have experienced many such situations.\"",
    "[According to the \"Daily Records of Emperor Xian,\" the Imperial Court dispatched Wang Yi, the Marquis of Anyang who was serving temporarily as Minister of Agriculture, and Liu Ai, the Director of the Imperial Clan, both carrying imperial tallies with five attendants, bearing gifts of silk and four horses, accompanied by eunuch attendants, palace stewards, and two regular palace attendants, to welcome two noble persons to the State of Wei. In the second month, on the day of Guihai, at the ancestral temple of Wei, the two noble persons were presented with official seals and ribbons. On the day of Jiazi, at the Yanqiu Gate of the Wei Palace, the noble persons were welcomed into the carriages. The Wei State sent the Director of Gentlemen-at-Court, the Junior Governor, the Imperial Scholar, the Imperial Stable Master, and ministers of the Chancellor's office to escort the noble persons. On the day of Guiyou, when the two noble persons arrived at the Weicang Palace, the Palace Attendant Dan led the Imperial Guard to welcome them with a relay of horses. On the day of Yihai, the two noble persons entered the palace, where the Imperial Censor-in-Chief, officials of the Two Thousand Picul rank, Grand Masters, and Deliberation Gentlemen gathered in the main hall. The two ministers of Wei State and attendants-in-waiting, along with two gentlemen of the palace, joined the Han ministers for a banquet in the hall.]",
    "In the third month, the Emperor ordered that Cao Cao, the Duke of Wei, be positioned above all other princes, and presented him with a golden seal, a red ribbon, and a cap for distant journeys. [According to the \"Daily Records of Emperor Xian,\" Left Palace Gentleman Yang Xuan and Marquis Pei Mao were sent carrying the imperial tally and seal to present these to him.]",
    "In autumn, during the seventh month, the Duke of Wei launched a campaign against Sun Quan. [According to the \"Chronicles of the Nine Provinces,\" Staff Officer Fu Gan remonstrated: \"There are two great instruments for ruling the world: civil virtue and military might. When using military force, one must first establish authority; when employing civil methods, one must first establish virtue. Only when authority and virtue complement each other can the way of the true king be complete. Previously, when the world was in great chaos and order was lost between ruler and subject, Your Lordship used military force to bring stability, pacifying nine-tenths of the realm. Now, only Wu and Shu have not submitted to imperial authority. Wu has the natural defense of the Yangtze River, and Shu has the barriers of high mountains—these make them difficult to subdue by force but easy to win over through virtue. In my humble opinion, you should temporarily restrain your troops and cease military operations, allow the army to rest and recover, divide the territories and establish fiefs, and distribute rewards according to merit. By doing so, the hearts of those both within and outside your domain will be secure, those with achievements will be encouraged, and the world will know your system of governance. Thereafter, gradually establish schools to guide their good nature and nurture their sense of righteousness and integrity. Your divine military prowess already inspires awe throughout the four seas; if you complement it with civil cultivation, then all under heaven will submit willingly. Now, if you deploy a hundred thousand troops at the banks of the Yangtze River, and the enemy entrenches deeply in their strongholds, your soldiers and horses will be unable to display their abilities, and there will be no opportunity to employ strategic changes—thus your great authority will be frustrated and the enemy's resolve will remain unbroken. I hope Your Lordship will consider the meaning behind Emperor Shun's dance with shield and axe—preserving authority while cultivating virtue, achieving victory through righteous means.\" Cao Cao did not follow this advice, and the military campaign ultimately achieved no success. Fu Gan, whose courtesy name was Yancai, was a man from Beidi and ended his career as an official in the Chancellor's Granary Bureau. He had a son named Xuan.]",
    "Earlier, Song Jian of Longxi had proclaimed himself King of Hesu Pinghan, gathering followers at Pohan. He established his own reign era and appointed officials, maintaining his position for over thirty years. Cao Cao dispatched Xiahou Yuan from Xingguo to campaign against him. In winter, during the tenth month, Pohan was sacked, Song Jian was beheaded, and the Liang Province was pacified.",
    "Cao Cao returned from Hefei.",
    "In the eleventh month, Empress Fu was accused of having previously written to her father, the former Colonel of the Imperial Guard Fu Wan, stating that Emperor Xian harbored resentment toward Cao Cao due to the execution of Dong Cheng. The language was extremely offensive. When this was discovered, the Empress was deposed and died, while her brothers were all executed. [According to the \"Biography of Cao Man,\" Cao Cao sent Hua Xin with troops to enter the palace and arrest the Empress. The Empress locked herself in a room and hid inside a wall cavity. Hua Xin broke down the door, opened the wall, and dragged the Empress out. At that time, the Emperor was sitting with the Imperial Censor-in-Chief Xi Lü. The Empress, with disheveled hair and barefoot, passed by and grasped the Emperor's hand, saying, \"Can you not save me?\" The Emperor replied, \"I myself do not know when my own life will end.\" The Emperor said to Xi Lü, \"Master Xi, how could such a thing happen in the world!\" Subsequently, the Empress was taken away and executed. Fu Wan and hundreds of members of his clan were also put to death.]",
    "In the twelfth month, Cao Cao arrived at Mengjin. The Emperor ordered that Cao Cao be granted a ceremonial banner with tassels and that bell frames be installed in his palace. On the day of Yiwei, Cao Cao issued an edict stating: \"Men of good character are not necessarily able to take initiative, and those who take initiative are not necessarily men of good character. Was Chen Ping a man of perfect conduct? Was Su Qin a man who kept his word? Yet Chen Ping secured the Han dynasty, and Su Qin saved the weak state of Yan. From this, we can see that even if a person has shortcomings, how can they be dismissed? If the officials in charge clearly understand this principle, then no talent will be overlooked, and no official position will be wasted.\" He also stated: \"The law determines the fate of the common people, yet those who administer justice in the military are sometimes unqualified, yet are entrusted with matters of life and death for the three armies—this greatly concerns me. Select those who understand the law and its principles to administer justice.\" Consequently, he established the position of Judicial Officer.",
    "In the spring of the twentieth year, during the first month, the Emperor installed Cao Cao's middle daughter as Empress. The commanderies of Yunzhong, Dingxiang, Wuyuan, and Shuofang were abolished and combined into a single county within each commandery to govern their populations, which were consolidated into the new Xinxing Commandery.",
    "In the third month, Cao Cao launched a western campaign against Zhang Lu, reaching Chencang. He planned to enter Di territory through Wudu, but the Di people blocked the roads. He first dispatched Zhang He, Zhu Ling, and others to attack and defeat them. In summer, during the fourth month, Cao Cao marched from Chencang through Sanguan Pass and arrived at Hechi. The Di King Dou Mao, with over ten thousand followers, relied on the difficult terrain and refused to submit. In the fifth month, Cao Cao attacked and massacred them. The various generals from Xiping and Jincheng, including Qu Yan and Jiang Shi, jointly beheaded Han Sui and sent his head to Cao Cao. [According to the \"Concise History,\" Han Sui, whose courtesy name was Wenyue, initially gained fame in the western provinces alongside his fellow countryman Bian Zhang. Zhang served as a Supervising Officer. Han Sui went to the capital to present plans, and He Jin, having long heard of his reputation, granted him a special audience. Han Sui advised He Jin to execute the eunuchs, but He Jin did not follow this advice, so Han Sui requested to return home. At that time, Song Yang, Beigong Yu, and others from Liang Province rebelled and selected Zhang and Han Sui as their leaders. Zhang soon died of illness, and Han Sui was coerced by Yang and others; having no choice, Han Sui used his troops to participate in the rebellion, which lasted for thirty-two years until his death at over seventy years of age. [According to Liu Ai's \"Records of Emperor Ling,\" Zhang was also known as Yuan.]",
    "In autumn, during the seventh month, Cao Cao reached Yangping. Zhang Lu sent his brother Wei along with General Yang Ang to defend Yangping Pass. They built fortifications spanning over ten li across the mountains, which could not be taken by assault. Cao Cao therefore withdrew his army. When the rebels saw the main army retreat, they relaxed their defenses. Cao Cao then secretly dispatched Jie Qian, Gao Zuo, and others to use the terrain's advantages for a night raid, achieving a great victory and beheading their general Yang Ren. He then attacked Wei, but Wei and others fled in the night, causing Zhang Lu to retreat in disorder to Bazhong. Cao Cao's army entered Nanzheng and captured all the treasures in Zhang Lu's treasury. [According to the \"Book of Wei,\" the army had marched a thousand li through the mountains of Wudu, ascending and descending treacherous terrain, causing the soldiers great hardship. Cao Cao therefore held a great feast, and all forgot their fatigue. Both Ba and Han surrendered. The Hanning Commandery was restored as Hanzhong; the Anyang and Xicheng areas of Hanzhong were split off to form Xicheng Commandery, with a governor appointed; and the Xi and Shangyong commanderies were divided, with commanders appointed.]",

    "In the ninth month, the Ba Seven Clans' tribal king Pu Hu and the Marquis of Ceng County, Du Hu, led the Ba and Ceng peoples to submit. (Sun Sheng notes: Pu is pronounced \"fu.\" Hu is pronounced \"hu.\") Thereupon, Ba Commandery was divided, with Pu Hu appointed as Governor of Eastern Ba and Du Hu as Governor of Western Ba, both enfeoffed as marquises. The Emperor authorized Cao Cao to bestow titles and appoint feudal lords, governors, and chancellors by his own authority. [According to Kong Yan's \"Spring and Autumn of Han and Wei,\" the Emperor, considering that Cao Cao held important responsibilities away from the capital and that rewards for meritorious service sometimes required immediate action, authorized him to appoint feudal lords, governors, and chancellors at his discretion. The edict stated: \"The greatest matter in military affairs is the system of rewards and punishments, encouraging good and punishing evil, which should be implemented without delay. Therefore, the 'Methods of the Marshal' states that 'rewards should not be delayed beyond a day,' because it is desirable for the people to quickly see the benefits of doing good. In the early restoration period, when Deng Yu entered the Pass, he had the authority to appoint the Army Ceremonial Officer Li Wen as Governor of Hedong, and Lai Xi also had the authority to appoint Gao Jun as General of Open Roads. Examining their biographies, neither required prior permission, clearly showing that they issued seals on the spot. This demonstrates that Emperor Guangwu, with divine wisdom, exercised his authority flexibly, adjusting according to circumstances, in order to quickly demonstrate his authority and establish great achievements. [According to the principles of the Spring and Autumn Annals, when a high official leaves the domain, he has certain independent powers in matters that benefit the state and secure the country. Moreover, you hold the position of the two Earls and govern the nine provinces, personally campaigning against the barbarians in distant territories beyond the frontier. Success or failure can be determined in an instant, and waiting for imperial approval for rewards would hinder state affairs—this is not my intention. From now on, when you identify those deserving of honorary titles on the spot, you may immediately create seals and bestow appointments, so that loyalty and righteousness may be mutually encouraged. Have no doubts about this.\"]",
    "In winter, during the tenth month, ranks from Named Marquis to Fifth Gentleman were first established, forming six grades together with the existing Ordinary Marquis and Interior Marquis, to reward military achievements. [According to the \"Book of Wei,\" eighteen grades of Named Marquis, seventeen grades of Central Marquis were established, all with gold seals and purple ribbons; sixteen grades of Interior and Exterior Marquis were established with bronze turtle-knob seals and black ribbons; and fifteen grades of Fifth Gentleman were established with bronze ring-knob seals and black ribbons. None received land grants, forming six grades together with the existing Ordinary Marquis and Interior Marquis. Historian Song Zhongzi comments that today's honorary titles began from this time.]",
    "In the eleventh month, Zhang Lu surrendered with his remaining followers from Bazhong. Zhang Lu and his five sons were all enfeoffed as marquises. Liu Bei had seized Liu Zhang's territory, taking control of Yi Province, and subsequently occupied Bazhong. Cao Cao dispatched Zhang He to attack him.",
    "In the twelfth month, Cao Cao returned from Nanzheng, leaving Xiahou Yuan to garrison Hanzhong. During this campaign, Palace Attendant Wang Can composed a five-character poem to praise the achievement, saying: \"Military service has its hardships and joys, but it depends on whom one follows. Following one who is divine and valiant, how can the army labor long? The Chancellor campaigns in the western passes, his fierce wrath shaking heaven's majesty. With one strike he destroys the Xiongnu, with a second he subdues the Qiang and Di. He pacifies the western bandits as easily as picking up abandoned items. The rewards presented exceed mountains, with meat and wine flowing like rivers. The army abounds with plentiful food, men and horses grow fat. Those who marched on foot return riding, those who left empty-handed return with surplus wealth. Expanding the territory by three thousand li, going and returning as swiftly as flight. Singing and dancing as they enter Ye City, all wishes fulfilled without failure.\"",
    "In the spring of the twenty-first year, during the second month, Cao Cao returned to Ye. [According to the \"Book of Wei,\" on the day of Xinwei, the officials announced his arrival with the appropriate sacrificial animals, and his achievements were recorded in the ancestral temple. On the day of Jiawu, the spring sacrifice began, and he issued an edict saying: \"Some argue that one should remove one's shoes when ascending the hall of the ancestral temple. I have received the imperial mandate and wear a sword, so I do not remove my shoes when ascending the hall. If I were to remove my shoes when entering the temple, I would be honoring my ancestors while neglecting the imperial command, respecting my forebears while disregarding my sovereign. Therefore, I dare not remove my shoes when ascending the hall. Additionally, before the sacrifice, when approaching to wash, some merely gesture toward the water without actually washing. Washing is done as a sign of respect through cleanliness, and I have never heard of a ritual where one gestures without washing. Moreover, 'when sacrificing to the spirits, act as if they were present,' so I personally receive the water and wash. Furthermore, after the ceremony of welcoming the spirits, some descend the steps to stand under the canopy, waiting for the music to finish, as though not delaying the sacrifice while the ancestors wait for the ceremony. Therefore, I remain seated until the music ends and only rise after sending off the spirits. When receiving the consecrated meat, some hand it to the spirits via the attendants-in-waiting, which shows respect but lacks sincerity. In ancient times, people personally conducted sacrificial affairs, so I personally present offerings to the spirits and carry them back in my arms. Confucius said, 'Though it goes against the majority, I follow what is right.' How true these words are!\"]",
    "On the day of Renyin in the third month, Cao Cao personally plowed the ceremonial field. [According to the \"Book of Wei,\" the officials presented a memorial: \"Military training is typically conducted during agricultural off-seasons in the four seasons. During the Han Dynasty, which continued the Qin system, training was not conducted in three seasons, but only in the tenth month when there was a comprehensive test of chariots and horses. The Emperor would visit the south gate of Changshui, where the five camps of soldiers would form into eight battle formations, advancing and retreating, which was called 'chariot riding.' Now, with weapons not yet laid down but soldiers and people well-practiced, from now on, there need be no military training in the four seasons. Instead, at the beginning of autumn, an auspicious day should be selected for a grand review of chariots and cavalry, to be called 'Regulating the Army.' This would align with ritual terminology above and continue the Han system below.\" This proposal was approved.]",
    "In summer, during the fifth month, the Emperor elevated Cao Cao's rank to King of Wei. [According to the \"Biography of Emperor Xian,\" the edict stated: \"Since ancient times, the titles and ranks of emperors and kings have varied and changed, yet there has been no difference in how they honor founding contributors, establish meritorious achievements, glorify family names, and extend these to descendants. The relationship between those of different surnames and those of imperial blood—how could there be any distinction? In the past, our sacred ancestors received the Mandate of Heaven, established the foundation of the enterprise, created our great domain, examined the systems of past and present, understood the differences in rank, and fully enfeoffed mountains and rivers to establish protective screens, allowing relatives of different surnames to equally possess territories, hold states, and serve as kings. This was done to protect the Heavenly Mandate and secure the myriad heirs. As dynasties continued in peace, rulers and ministers had no difficulties. When the Han restoration occurred, there were times of ease and difficulty, which is why for hundreds of years, there have been no feudal kings of different surnames.]",
    "\"I, lacking in virtue, have succeeded to the great enterprise, only to encounter the disintegration of the realm, the rampage of villains, and the movement from west to east in hardship and humility. During this time, I feared only drowning in difficulties, bringing shame to the divine virtue of my imperial predecessors. Thanks to the blessing of August Heaven, you, my lord, have upheld righteousness with decisive action, displaying divine martial prowess, protecting me through difficulties, preserving the ancestral temples, and benefiting the Han people and all living beings—none have not received your grace. Your diligence surpasses that of Ji and Yu, your loyalty equals that of Yi and Zhou, yet you cloak these virtues in humility and maintain utmost reverence. Therefore, when previously establishing Wei State and granting you land, I feared you would disobey my command and decline firmly, so I temporarily restrained my intentions and compromised by enfeoffing you as a High Duke, wishing to respect your lofty virtue while awaiting further achievements. Han Sui and Song Jian allied with Ba and Shu in the south, gathering rebels to threaten the state. You again led your generals, advancing with dragon-like speed and tiger-like ferocity, beheading their leaders and destroying their lairs. Then during the western campaign, at the battle of Yangping, you personally donned armor, penetrated deep into dangerous terrain, eradicated the rebellious vermin, eliminated their vicious forces, pacified the western frontier, displayed your banners for ten thousand li, spreading your influence far and wide, bringing peace to our domain.",
    "\"During the glory of Tang and Yu, the Three Dukes established their achievements; during the rise of Kings Wen and Wu, Dan and Yi served as assistants; when our two founding emperors established their enterprise, heroes and talents aided their mandate. Even when sage rulers personally took on responsibilities, they still bestowed ranks and auspicious objects to reward meritorious ministers. How could I, with such limited virtue, relying on you for assistance, not provide generous rewards? How else could I respond to the divine spirits and comfort the myriad regions? Today, I advance your rank to King of Wei and send an envoy bearing the imperial tally—the Imperial Censor-in-Chief and Director of the Imperial Clan Liu Ai—to present you with the seal, black earth for the state altar, white reeds, golden tiger tallies from first to fifth rank, and bamboo envoy tallies from first to tenth. You shall assume the position of King, while continuing to serve as Chancellor and Governor of Ji Province as before. Return your Duke of Wei seal, ribbon, tally, and certificate. Respectfully accept my command, be considerate of your people, achieve stability in all affairs, and thereby glorify the splendid mandate of my ancestors.\"",
    "The King of Wei submitted three memorials declining the honor, but the Emperor issued three edicts refusing these declinations. The Emperor also wrote a personal edict: \"The great sages considered virtue and merit as the highest beauty, and loyalty and harmony as the primary teaching. Therefore, they established enterprises and left their names, making them worthy of emulation for a hundred generations; they practiced the Way and established righteousness, making their actions models for imitation. Thus, their merit is endless, and their glorious light brightly shines. Ji and Xie loaded the sovereigns with brilliance, while Zhou and Shao benefited from the wisdom of Kings Wen and Wu. Though they managed various offices, looking up in admiration and thinking down in reflection, how could their equivalents be found but in you? When I consider the achievements of the ancients, praised as they were, and ponder your loyal and diligent service, flourishing as it is, I therefore prepare to engrave seals and divide talismans, presenting ceremonial appointments with certificates. Day and night I sigh deeply, forgetting my own unworthy virtue of maintaining what was established. Now you repeatedly disobey my command, firmly declining with sincere words—this does not satisfy my heart, nor does it instruct future generations. Therefore, restrain your will and control your modesty—do not firmly decline again.\"",
    "[According to the \"Preface on the Four Styles of Calligraphy,\" Liang Hu stated that Cao Cao had served as Constable of the Northern District. The \"Biography of Cao Man\" says that he was recommended by Sima Jian Gong, the Right Assistant Clerk of the Imperial Secretariat. When Cao Cao became King, he summoned Jian Gong to Ye, drank joyfully with him, and said to him, \"Could I still serve as a constable today?\" Jian Gong replied, \"When I recommended Your Majesty, you were just suitable to be a constable.\" The King laughed heartily. Jian Gong's personal name was Fang, and he was the father of Sima Xuan Wang. Historian Song Zhongzi notes that according to the \"Preface to Biographies by Sima Biao,\" Jian Gong was not a Right Assistant. This account may be incorrect, but Wang Yin's \"Book of Jin\" states that when the King of Zhao usurped the throne and wished to posthumously honor his ancestor as emperor, the Scholar Ma Ping argued that the Prefect of Jingzhao had once recommended Cao Cao, the King of Wei, as Constable of the Northern District, and bandits did not violate the boundaries.

    "The Acting Shanyu Pufulan of the Wuhuan of Dai Commandery, along with his chieftains, came to pay homage. The Emperor decreed that the King's daughter be made a princess with estates providing bath and cosmetic funds.

The Right Worthy King Qupi was appointed to oversee their state. In the eighth month, the Minister of Justice Zhong Yao was appointed as Chancellor of State.",

In the second month, he advanced his troops to camp at Haoxi, west of the Yangtze River.

In the third month, the King withdrew his army, leaving Xiahou Dun, Cao Ren, Zhang Liao, and others to garrison Chao.",
    "In summer, during the fourth month, the Emperor decreed that the King should use imperial banners and flags, and be announced with ceremonial calls when entering or exiting. In the fifth month, a Pan Palace (semi-circular moat palace for education) was constructed. In the sixth month, Military Advisor Hua Xin was appointed as Imperial Censor-in-Chief. [According to the \"Book of Wei,\" the office of Commandant of Guards was first established at this time. In autumn, during the eighth month, Cao Cao issued an edict stating: \"In ancient times, Yi Zhi and Fu Yue emerged from humble origins, while Guan Zhong had been an enemy of Duke Huan, yet all were employed to achieve greatness. Xiao He and Cao Can were merely county officials; Han Xin and Chen Ping bore disgraceful reputations and suffered shameful humiliation, yet ultimately they established the royal enterprise with fame lasting a thousand years. Wu Qi was a greedy general who killed his wife to prove his loyalty, scattered gold to seek office, and did not return for his mother's funeral. Yet in Wei, he was so effective that no one dared to look eastward; in Chu, the Three Jin States dared not plot southward. Today, there may be people of great virtue hidden among the common people, or those of exceptional courage who fight fearlessly when facing the enemy; there may be scholarly officials with outstanding talents and unusual qualities who could serve as generals or governors; there may even be those with tarnished names and shameful histories, or those who lack benevolence or filial piety yet possess skills in governing the state or commanding troops: each of you should recommend those you know, let none be overlooked.\"]",
    "In winter, during the tenth month, the Emperor ordered that the King be granted a ceremonial cap with twelve pendants, ride in a chariot with golden hubs drawn by six horses, be provided with five auxiliary chariots according to the seasons, and appointed his son Cao Pi, the General of the Gentlemen of the Palace, as Crown Prince of Wei.",
    "Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei, Ma Chao, Wu Lan, and others to garrison Xiabian; Cao Cao dispatched Cao Hong to oppose them.",
    "In the spring of the twenty-third year, during the first month, the Imperial Physician Ji Ben, along with the Junior Governor Geng Ji, the Rectifier Wei Huang, and others rebelled. They attacked Xu, burning the camp of Wang Bi, the Chief Clerk of the Chancellor. [According to the \"Records of King Wu of Wei,\" Cao Cao had issued an edict saying: \"The Chief Clerk Wang Bi has been my official since the time when I was cutting through thorns and brambles. He is loyal, capable, diligent in affairs, with a heart like iron and stone—a fine official of the state. For long I had failed to employ him properly, like keeping a fine steed without riding it—why should I hurriedly seek another? Therefore, I have instructed that he be appointed, already assigned an appropriate position, and continue to serve as Chief Clerk to oversee affairs as before.\" Wang Bi, together with Yan Kuang, the Agricultural Officer of Yingchuan, attacked and executed the rebels.]",
    "[According to the \"Annotations to the Three Adjuncts Records,\" at that time there was a man named Jin Yi from Jingzhao, courtesy name De Yi, who considered himself a hereditary minister of the Han Dynasty. Since the time of Jin Midi's suppression of Wang Mang's general He Luo, his family's loyalty had been well-known, with their reputation extending for generations. Seeing that the Han mandate was about to be transferred and believing it could be revived, he sighed with determination and conspired with Geng Ji, Wei Huang, Ji Ben, Ben's son Miao, and Miao's brother Mu. Geng Ji, courtesy name Ji Xing, was reputed for excellence from a young age and served as an official under the Chancellor. The King highly respected him and appointed him as Palace Attendant and Junior Governor. Ji Miao's courtesy name was Wen Ran, and Mu's courtesy name was Si Ran. They considered Jin Yi to have Jin Midi's passionate character, and as he was on good terms with Wang Bi, they sought to alienate him. If they could kill Wang Bi, they planned to take control of the Emperor to attack Wei and seek southern assistance from Liu Bei. At that time, Guan Yu was powerful, and the King was in Ye, leaving Wang Bi in command of troops and supervising affairs in Xu. Wen Ran and others led over a thousand miscellaneous people and household servants to attack Wang Bi's camp by night, setting fire to the gates. Jin Yi sent someone to coordinate from within, shooting an arrow that struck Wang Bi in the shoulder. Wang Bi, not knowing who the attackers were, tried to seek refuge with Jin Yi due to their good relationship. At night, he called out to De Yi, but Jin Yi's family, not recognizing it was Wang Bi and thinking it was Wen Ran and his associates, mistakenly responded: \"Is Chief Clerk Wang dead yet? Your plan has succeeded!\" Wang Bi then fled by another route. One account states: Wang Bi intended to seek refuge with Jin Yi, but his commander said to him, \"In today's situation, how do you know which door to enter?\" He then helped Wang Bi flee to the southern city. By daybreak, Wang Bi was still alive, and Wen Ran's followers had dispersed, thus the rebellion failed. More than ten days later, Wang Bi eventually died from his wounds.]",
    "[According to the \"Spring and Autumn Annals of Emperor Xian,\" when Geng Ji, Wei Huang, and others were captured and about to be executed, Geng Ji called out Cao Cao's name saying: \"I regret not acting on my own initiative but was ultimately misled by these youngsters!\" Wei Huang kowtowed and slapped his face until death.]",
    "[According to the \"Records of the Prince of Shanyang,\" when Cao Cao heard of Wang Bi's death, he was furious and summoned all Han officials to Ye. He ordered those who had helped fight the fire to stand on the left, and those who had not to stand on the right. Many people thought that those who fought the fire would be innocent, so they stood on the left. Cao Cao declared, \"Those who did not fight the fire were not assisting the rebellion, while those who fought the fire were actually the real bandits.\" All of them were executed.]",
    "Cao Hong defeated Wu Lan and beheaded his general Ren Kui and others. In the third month, Zhang Fei and Ma Chao fled to Hanzhong. Qiang Duan of the Di people from Yinping beheaded Wu Lan and sent his head.",
    "In summer, during the fourth month, the Wuhuan people of Dai Commandery and Shangjun, led by Wu Chenyi and others, rebelled. The Marquis of Yanling, Cao Zhang, was sent to attack and defeat them. [According to the \"Book of Wei,\" the King issued an edict saying: \"Last winter, epidemics spread, and the people suffered greatly. With military campaigns abroad and reduced farmland cultivation, I am deeply concerned. Therefore, order that among the officials and common people: women aged seventy or above without husbands or sons, those aged twelve or below without parents or siblings, as well as those who cannot see, work with their hands, or walk, and who have no wives, children, fathers, brothers, or property, shall receive food provisions for life. For the young until the age of twelve who are too poor to support themselves, provide loans according to the number of mouths to feed. For the elderly who need care, those aged ninety or above shall be exempted from duties, with one person per family excused.\"]",
    "In the sixth month, an edict was issued: \"In ancient burials, people were always buried in barren lands. Let the area west of the Wang Bao shrine on the western plateau be designated as the Longevity Mausoleum, using the natural elevation as the foundation, without additional mounding or planting trees. [According to the Zhou Rituals, the Tomb Keeper was in charge of public cemetery lands, with feudal lords positioned to the left, right, and front, while ministers and high officials were positioned behind—the Han system also referred to this as 'companion tombs.' Ministers, high officials, and meritorious generals should be buried accompanying the Longevity Mausoleum, with sufficient land allocated for their tombs to accommodate them all.\"]",
    "In autumn, during the seventh month, after reviewing the troops, Cao Cao launched a western campaign against Liu Bei, arriving at Chang'an in the ninth month.",
    "In winter, during the tenth month, the garrison commander of Wan, Hou Yin, and others rebelled, capturing the Governor of Nanyang, and plundering officials and people while holding Wan. Earlier, Cao Ren had been fighting against Guan Yu and was stationed at Fan City. In this month, Cao Ren was ordered to besiege Wan.",
    "In the spring of the twenty-fourth year, during the first month, Cao Ren sacked Wan and executed Hou Yin. [According to the \"Biography of Cao Man,\" at that time, the people of Nanyang were suffering from excessive labor and taxes. Hou Yin seized the Governor of Nanyang, Dong Li Bao, and rebelled together with officials and people, forming an alliance with Guan Yu. The Administrative Officer of Nanyang, Zong Ziping, went to persuade Hou Yin, saying: \"You have followed the people's wishes and raised a great enterprise, with everyone near and far looking to you with admiration. However, holding the commandery's leader prisoner is both rebellious and pointless—why not release him? Let us join forces, and by the time Cao Cao's army arrives, Guan Yu's forces will also be here.\" Hou Yin agreed and released the Governor. Zong Ziping then escaped over the city wall at night and, together with the Governor, gathered the remaining people to surround Hou Yin. When Cao Ren's army arrived, they jointly eliminated the rebels.]",
    "Xiahou Yuan fought against Liu Bei at Yangping and was killed by Liu Bei's forces. In the third month, the King of Wei marched from Chang'an through Xiagu, positioning his troops at strategic points overlooking Hanzhong, and eventually reached Yangping. Liu Bei relied on the difficult terrain to maintain his defense. [According to the \"Chronicles of the Nine Provinces,\" when the King decided to withdraw, he issued an order using the phrase \"chicken ribs.\" His officials did not understand the meaning. However, Yang Xiu, the Chief Clerk, immediately prepared to depart. People were surprised and asked him, \"How did you know?\" Yang Xiu replied, \"Chicken ribs are such that discarding them seems wasteful, yet eating them yields little benefit. This is compared to Hanzhong, indicating that the King wishes to withdraw.\"]",
    "In summer, during the fifth month, Cao Cao withdrew his army to Chang'an.",
    "In autumn of the seventh month, Lady Bian was appointed Queen. Yu Jin was dispatched to assist Cao Ren in attacking Guan Yu. In the eighth month, the Han River flooded, inundating Yu Jin's forces. His army was destroyed, and Yu Jin was captured by Guan Yu, who then surrounded Cao Ren. Xu Huang was sent to rescue Cao Ren.",
    "In the ninth month, Chancellor Zhong Yao was dismissed from his post due to a rebellion by Wei Feng, an official in the Western Department. [According to the \"Shiyu\" Records of the World: \"Wei Feng, styled Zijing, was from Pei. He had the talent to beguile crowds and stirred up trouble throughout Ye, which is why Zhong Yao had summoned him. While the main army was away, Wei Feng secretly gathered followers and conspired with Chen Yi, the Captain of the Palace Guard, to attack Ye. Before they could act, Chen Yi grew fearful and reported the plot to the Crown Prince. Wei Feng was executed, and dozens of his associates were put to death. The family instructions of Wang Chang mention 'Wei Feng of Ji Yin,' but this account says he was from Pei, so the details remain unclear.\"]",
    "In winter of the tenth month, the army returned to Luoyang. [According to the \"Biography of Cao Man\": \"The King ordered renovations to the office of the Northern District Captain, making it grander than before.\" Sun Quan sent envoys with a memorial offering to attack Guan Yu to demonstrate his loyalty. The King departed south from Luoyang to attack Guan Yu but before he arrived, Xu Huang had already attacked and defeated Guan Yu, who fled, thus lifting the siege on Cao Ren. The King's army camped at Mobi.]",
    "[According to the \"Wei Lüe\" Brief History of Wei: \"Sun Quan sent a memorial addressing himself as a subject and speaking of Heaven's mandate. The King showed Sun Quan's letter to others, saying, 'Does this boy wish to sit on my hot stove?' The Palace Attendant Chen Qun and Minister Huan Jie submitted a memorial saying: 'Since Emperor An, the Han dynasty has lost governmental authority, and the imperial lineage has been repeatedly broken. Today, only the name remains; not an inch of land nor a single person truly belongs to Han. Its allotted time has long been exhausted, and its destined cycle completed—this did not just happen today. During the reigns of Emperors Huan and Ling, all those who understood the celestial charts and prophecies said that \"Han's energy is spent, and the Yellow family shall rise.\" Your Highness has met the appointed time, possessing nine-tenths of the empire, yet still serving Han. The people look to you with expectation, and all near and far sigh with impatience. This is why Sun Quan from afar declares himself your subject—it is the response of Heaven and men, different energies speaking with one voice. In our humble opinion, the Xia and Yu dynasties did not decline out of humility, and the Shang and Zhou dynasties did not hesitate to overthrow their predecessors. They feared Heaven and understood fate, yielding to no one.'\"]",
    "[The \"Spring and Autumn Annals of Wei\" states: \"Xiahou Dun said to the King, 'All under Heaven know that the Han mandate has expired and a new dynasty is rising. Since ancient times, those who eliminate suffering for the people and earn their allegiance become the people's ruler. Your Highness has been campaigning for over thirty years, your achievements and virtue are manifest to the common people, and the world looks to you for leadership. By responding to Heaven and following the people's will, what more is there to hesitate about?' The King replied, 'To serve in an existing government is also governance. If Heaven's Mandate rests with me, then I am like King Wen of Zhou.'\"]",
    "[Both the \"Biography of Cao Man\" and \"Shiyu\" record that Huan Jie urged the King to take the throne, while Xiahou Dun believed they should first eliminate Shu, after which Wu would submit. Once both regions were pacified, then they could follow the path of Shun and Yu. The King followed this advice. After the King's death, Xiahou Dun regretted his counsel, fell ill with grief, and died. Sun Sheng commented: \"Xiahou Dun was ashamed to serve as a Han official and sought to receive a Wei seal, while Huan Jie, unlike Dun, possessed righteous integrity. Examining the records, the account in 'Shiyu' must be false.\"]",
    "In the twenty-fifth year, spring, first month, the King returned to Luoyang. Sun Quan had attacked and beheaded Guan Yu, sending his head to the King.",
    "On the day Gengzi, the King died in Luoyang at the age of sixty-six. [According to \"Shiyu\": \"After the King returned from Hanzhong to Luoyang, he ordered the construction of the Jianshi Palace. When the sacred tree at the Zhuolong Shrine was cut down, blood flowed from it.\" The \"Biography of Cao Man\" states: \"The King ordered the craftsman Su Yue to transplant a beautiful pear tree. When it was dug up, its damaged roots began to bleed. Su Yue reported this, and the King personally inspected it. Finding it ominous, he returned to his quarters and fell ill.\"]",
    "His final edict stated: \"The empire is not yet pacified, so we cannot yet follow ancient customs. After the burial, all shall cease mourning. Those commanding troops in garrisons must not leave their posts. Officials shall each attend to their duties. Dress me in everyday clothes, with no gold, jade, or treasures.\" He was posthumously titled King Wu. On the day Dingmao of the second month, he was buried at Gaoling.",
    "[According to the \"Book of Wei\": \"When Cao Cao controlled the empire and eliminated the various rebels, his military campaigns generally followed the methods of Sun Tzu and Wu Qi, but he adapted with ingenuity, deceived enemies to achieve victory, and transformed his tactics with divine unpredictability. He personally wrote military treatises of over 100,000 words, which his generals followed on campaigns. In critical moments, he would personally issue commands; those who followed his instructions succeeded, while those who disobeyed faced defeat. When facing enemies in battle, his demeanor was calm and relaxed, as if reluctant to fight, yet when the decisive moment came, his momentum was overwhelming. Thus, every battle ended in victory, with no fortunate accidents.]",
    "[He was excellent at judging character and was not easily deceived. He elevated Yu Jin and Yue Jin from the ranks, and recruited Zhang Liao and Xu Huang from among former enemies. All of these men assisted him in establishing merit and became famous generals. Countless others rose from humble origins to become governors through his recognition. Thus, he created his great enterprise through both civil and military means. Commanding armies for over thirty years, he never set aside his books—studying military strategy by day and classical texts by night. Whenever he ascended heights, he would compose poetry. His new poems, when set to music, all became popular songs.]",
    "[His talents far exceeded others    ; he could shoot flying birds and personally hunt fierce beasts. Once at Nanpi, he shot sixty-three pheasants in a single day. When constructing palaces or repairing implements, he personally set the standards, all according to his own ideas. By nature frugal, he disliked ostentation. The women of his rear palace did not wear brocade or embroidery, and his attendants' shoes were not of two colors. When screens or curtains wore out, they were mended. His bedding was kept warm but had no decorative edges. When capturing cities and territories, he would distribute all luxurious items to those with merit. For those deserving reward, he did not begrudge thousands of gold, but for those without merit who expected gifts, he would not give even a fraction. Tributes from various regions were shared with his subordinates. Finding funeral regulations and succession ceremonies complicated and useless, with custom making them even more excessive, he predesignated his own burial clothes, amounting to just four chests.\"]",
    "[According to the \"Book of Fu Zi\": \"Cao Cao was concerned about the extravagance of marriage ceremonies. When public daughters were married off, they used only black canopies, and accompanying maids never exceeded ten people.\"]",
    "[Zhang Hua's \"Records of Many Things\" states: \"During the Han dynasty, Cui Yuan of Anping, his son Cui Shi, Zhang Zhi of Hongnong, and his brother Zhang Chang were all skilled in cursive script, and Cao Cao nearly matched them. Huan Tan and Cai Yong were skilled in music, while Shan Zidao of Pingyi, Wang Jiuzhen, Guo Kai and others were skilled in the game of weiqi—Cao Cao was equal to all of them. He was also interested in health cultivation methods and understood medicine and herbs. He recruited practitioners of esoteric arts: Zuo Ci of Lujiang, Hua Tuo of Qiaogun, Gan Shi of Ganling, and Que Jian of Yangcheng all came to his court. He also practiced consuming small amounts of wild aconite up to one chi in length and could even drink small quantities of zhen poison.\"]",
    "[According to the \"Book of Fu Zi\": \"By the end of the Han dynasty, many nobles had abandoned royal attire and adopted headcloths as elegant fashion. Even military leaders like Yuan Shao and Cui Bao all wore silk headcloths. Wei Cao Cao, considering that the world was suffering from famine and resources were scarce, designed a cap based on the ancient skin cap but made from silk fabric, conforming to the principle of simplicity appropriate to the times. Different colors distinguished ranks, a practice that continues today. This could be called military attire, not state attire.\"]",
    "[The \"Biography of Cao Man\" states: \"Cao Cao was by nature frivolous and lacked gravitas. He enjoyed music and kept actors and entertainers by his side from dawn until dusk. He wore light silk garments and personally carried a small pouch containing handkerchiefs and small items. Sometimes he would wear a casual cap when meeting guests. When conversing with others, he would joke and recite poetry without restraint. When pleased, he would laugh heartily, even to the point of dipping his head into serving vessels, staining his caps and handkerchiefs with food—such was his casualness.]",
    "[However, he enforced laws with extreme severity. Any general whose strategies surpassed his own would be executed according to law. Old acquaintances and former enemies were likewise shown no mercy. Yet for those he executed, he would often weep and lament before them, though never sparing their lives. Earlier, when Yuan Zhong was magistrate of Pei, he had once sought to prosecute Cao Cao according to law. Huan Shao of Pei also looked down on him. When Cao Cao governed Yanzhou, Chen Liu Bian Rang's criticism somewhat offended Cao Cao, who killed Bian Rang and exterminated his family. Yuan Zhong and Huan Shao both fled to Jiaozho, where Cao Cao sent envoys to Governor Shi Xie demanding their execution along with their entire clans. Huan Shao managed to present himself and kowtowed in apology in the courtyard. Cao Cao said to him, 'Do you think kneeling can spare your life?' and then killed him.]",
    "[Once when marching his army through wheat fields, he ordered, 'Any soldier who damages the wheat will be executed.' All the cavalry dismounted and passed through the wheat carefully. However, Cao Cao's own horse leapt into the wheat field. He instructed his secretary to determine his punishment. The secretary replied according to the Spring and Autumn principle that 'punishment does not apply to the noble.' Cao Cao said, 'How can I lead others if I make laws but break them myself? As the army commander, I cannot take my own life, but I shall punish myself.' He then drew his sword and cut off some of his hair, placing it on the ground.]",
    "[On another occasion, a favored concubine was with him during a daytime nap. Using her as a pillow, he told her, 'Wake me shortly.' Seeing him sleeping peacefully, she did not wake him. When he awoke naturally, he beat her to death.]",
    "[Once when fighting bandits, grain rations were insufficient. He privately asked the supply officer, 'What can be done?' The officer replied, 'We could use smaller measuring containers to make it last.' Cao Cao said, 'Good.' Later, when soldiers complained that Cao Cao was deceiving them, he told the supply officer, 'I must borrow your death to appease the troops, or this matter will not be resolved.' He beheaded the officer and displayed the head with an announcement: 'Executed at the camp gate for using small measures and stealing official grain.' Such was the nature of his cruelty, violence, and deception.\"]",
    "An appraisal: At the end of the Han dynasty, the empire was in great disorder, with powerful warlords rising everywhere. Yuan Shao controlled four provinces with unmatched strength. Cao Cao deployed strategies and devised plans, disciplining the entire realm. He adopted the legal techniques of Shang Yang and Shen Buhai, and the brilliant strategies of Han Fei and Bai Qi. He appointed officials according to their talents, utilizing each according to their abilities. He adjusted his temperament and employed calculation, not dwelling on old grudges. That he was ultimately able to control the imperial authority and establish a great enterprise was due to his superior intelligence and foresight. Truly, he can be called an extraordinary person and an outstanding hero who transcended his age.",

  "Zhang Liao",
  "Zhang Liao, courtesy name Wenyuan, was a native of Ma County in Yanmen. Originally a descendant of Nie Yi, he changed his surname to avoid a family feud. In his youth, he served as a county official. Near the end of the Han dynasty, Ding Yuan, the Inspector of Bingzhou, recognized Zhang Liao's exceptional martial prowess and summoned him as an attendant, sending him with troops to the capital. He Jin dispatched Liao to northern China to recruit soldiers, and he obtained over a thousand men. Upon his return, Jin had been defeated, so Liao's forces were assigned to Dong Zhuo. After Dong Zhuo's defeat, his troops were transferred to Lü Bu, and Liao was promoted to Cavalry Commandant. When Lü Bu was defeated by Li Jue, Liao followed Bu east to Xuzhou and became Magistrate of Lu, at which time he was twenty-eight years old.",
  "When Cao Cao defeated Lü Bu at Xiapi, Liao surrendered his forces and was appointed Palace Attendant and enfeoffed as Marquis within the Passes. After numerous military achievements, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. After Yuan Shao was defeated, Liao was separately dispatched to pacify various counties in the Lu region. Together with Xiahou Yuan, he besieged Chang Xi at Donghai. After several months their provisions were exhausted, and they discussed withdrawing their forces. Liao said to Yuan, \"For several days now, whenever I inspect our positions, Xi fixes his gaze on me. Also, his arrow fire has become less frequent. This must mean Xi is hesitating in his plans and therefore not fighting with full strength. I wish to draw him into conversation—perhaps I can persuade him.\" He then sent a message to Xi saying, \"Lord Cao has a command for you, and has sent me to deliver it.\" Xi indeed came down to speak with Liao. Liao explained to him, \"Lord Cao is divinely martial and is currently using virtue to pacify all regions. Those who submit early will receive great rewards.\" Xi then agreed to surrender.",
  "Liao subsequently went alone up Mount Sangong, entered Xi's household, and paid respects to his wife and children. Xi was delighted and accompanied him to see Cao Cao. Cao Cao sent Xi back, but reprimanded Liao, saying, \"This is not how a great general should act.\" Liao apologized: \"I knew that my lord's authority and trustworthiness are renowned throughout the four seas, and as I was carrying out your sacred edict, I was certain Xi would not dare harm me.\" He accompanied Cao Cao in campaigns against Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at Liyang, where he achieved merit and was made General of the Firm Center. He joined the attack on Shang at Ye, but Shang defended firmly and could not be defeated.",
  "When Cao Cao returned to Xu, he sent Liao and Yue Jin to take Yin'an and relocate its people to Henan. Later, Liao rejoined the attack on Ye. After Ye fell, he separately pacified Zhao State and Changshan, persuading various bandits along the mountains and Black Mountain bandit Sun Qing and others to surrender. When he joined the attack on Yuan Tan and Tan was defeated, Liao was dispatched separately to pacify the coastal areas, defeating eastern bandit Liu Yi and others. Upon returning to Ye, Cao Cao personally went out to welcome him and invited him to ride in his carriage. Cao Cao appointed him General Who Quells Bandits.",
  "Later, he was sent separately to attack Jingzhou, pacified various counties in Jiangxia, and returned to garrison Linying, where he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting. When he accompanied Cao Cao on a campaign against Yuan Shang at Liucheng, they suddenly encountered the enemy. Liao urged Cao Cao to fight, showing great enthusiasm. Cao Cao was impressed and personally handed his command banner to Liao. They then attacked and decisively defeated the enemy, beheading the Chanyu Dadun.",
  "[According to the \"Book of Fu Zi\": When Cao Cao was about to campaign against Liucheng, Liao advised him: \"Xu is the Emperor's meeting place. Now the Emperor is in Xu, and if you campaign far to the north, what if Liu Biao sends Liu Bei to seize Xu and use it to issue commands to the realm? Your lordship's position would be lost.\" Cao Cao calculated that Biao would not be able to employ Bei effectively, and so proceeded with the campaign.]",
  "At that time, Jingzhou was not yet pacified, so Liao was again sent to garrison Changshe. Just before departure, there were conspirators in the army who caused a disturbance at night by setting fires, throwing the entire army into confusion. Liao said to those around him, \"Do not move. This is not an entire camp in rebellion—there must be troublemakers who want to create chaos.\" He then ordered the loyal soldiers in the camp to remain seated calmly. Liao led several dozen of his personal guards to take position in the center of the formation. After a while, the situation stabilized, and they captured and executed the ringleaders.",
  "When Chen Lan and Mei Cheng rebelled with six Di counties, Cao Cao sent Yu Jin, Zang Ba and others to attack Cheng, while Liao led Zhang He, Niu Gai and others to attack Lan. Cheng pretended to surrender to Jin, who then withdrew. Cheng subsequently joined his forces with Lan and moved into the Luo Mountains. In the Luo Mountains was Mount Tianzhu, which rose steeply for more than twenty li, with dangerous and narrow paths that were barely passable on foot. Lan and his associates had fortified the top. When Liao wanted to advance, his generals said, \"We have few troops and the roads are dangerous—it would be difficult to penetrate deeply.\" Liao replied, \"This is what is called one against one, and the brave prevail.\" He then advanced to the foot of the mountain, established a camp, attacked, beheaded Chen Lan and Mei Cheng, and captured all their followers. When Cao Cao evaluated the achievements of his generals, he said, \"Climbing Heaven Mountain, traversing steep dangers to capture Lan and Cheng—this is the achievement of quelling bandits.\" He increased Liao's territory and granted him the ceremonial axe.",
  "After Cao Cao returned from his campaign against Sun Quan, he assigned Liao, Yue Jin, Li Dian and others, commanding over seven thousand men, to garrison Hefei. When Cao Cao campaigned against Zhang Lu, he left instructions with Army Protector Xue Ti, marking the envelope: \"Only to be opened when the enemy arrives.\" Shortly afterward, Sun Quan led 100,000 troops to surround Hefei. The generals opened the instructions together, which read: \"If Sun Quan comes, Generals Zhang and Li shall go out to battle; General Yue shall defend the Army Protector and must not engage in battle.\" All the generals were doubtful.",
  "Liao said, \"Our lord is campaigning far away. By the time reinforcements arrive, we will certainly be defeated. That is why his instructions direct us to strike before they fully engage, breaking their powerful momentum to reassure our troops, after which we can defend effectively. The key to success or failure lies in this one battle—why do you gentlemen doubt?\" Li Dian agreed with Liao. That night, Liao recruited eight hundred brave volunteers, slaughtered oxen for a feast for the officers and men, and prepared for major battle the next day.",
  "At dawn, Liao donned his armor, grasped his halberd, and was first to charge into the enemy formation. He killed several dozen men, beheaded two generals, and shouted his name loudly as he broke through the enemy camp, reaching Sun Quan's command position. Quan was greatly alarmed, and his troops were thrown into confusion, not knowing what to do. Quan fled to a high mound and defended himself with a long halberd. Liao shouted for Quan to come down and fight, but Quan did not dare move. Seeing that Liao had brought few troops, Quan had his forces surround Liao in multiple layers. Liao waved away those surrounding him and charged forward fiercely. When the encirclement broke, Liao led several dozen of his men out, but the rest of his troops called out, \"General, are you abandoning us?\" Liao then turned back, broke through the encirclement again, and extracted the remaining troops. Sun Quan's men and horses were all scattered, with none daring to oppose him.",
  "From dawn until midday they fought. The Wu forces lost their momentum and returned to repair their defenses. The morale of Liao's troops was stabilized, and all the generals were convinced. Sun Quan besieged Hefei for over ten days but could not take the city and finally withdrew. Liao led the various armies in pursuit, nearly capturing Sun Quan. Cao Cao greatly praised Liao and appointed him General Who Conquers the East.",
  "[Sun Sheng commented: \"In warfare, deception is fundamental, with orthodox and unorthodox approaches supporting each other. When appointing a general for an expedition, transferring command authority, sometimes one relies on a sudden opportunity or on the advantage of a pincer attack. If the various commanders are not in harmony, it becomes a path to abandoning the army. Regarding the defense of Hefei, it was isolated and without support. Relying solely on the brave would lead to a love of battle and create problems, while relying solely on the cautious would make it difficult to maintain morale against fear. Moreover, when the enemy is numerous and our forces few, they will become complacent; by using troops ready to die to strike complacent soldiers, victory is certain; with victory comes successful defense, and with defense comes security. That is why Cao Cao carefully selected complementary personnel, combining similar and different temperaments, provided them with secret instructions, controlling when and how these would be implemented. When events unfolded as anticipated, it was like fitting together perfectly matching tallies—truly marvelous!\"]",
  "In the 21st year of Jian'an (216 CE), Cao Cao again campaigned against Sun Quan and arrived at Hefei. He toured the site of Liao's battle and sighed deeply for a long while. He then increased Liao's troops, left many military units behind, and relocated the garrison to Juchao.",
  "When Guan Yu besieged Cao Ren at Fan, Sun Quan declared his allegiance to Wei, so Liao and all the armies were recalled to rescue Ren. Before Liao arrived, Xu Huang had already defeated Guan Yu and lifted the siege on Ren. Liao met with Cao Cao at Mopi. When Liao's army arrived, Cao Cao rode out in his carriage to acknowledge their efforts, and then returned to garrison in Chen Commandery. When Emperor Wen (Cao Pi) ascended to the position of King, he promoted Liao to Front General.",
  "[According to the \"Book of Wei\": \"The King bestowed upon Liao a thousand rolls of silk and ten thousand hu of grain.\"]",
  "He separately enfeoffed Liao's brother Fan and one of Liao's sons as marquises. When Sun Quan rebelled again, Liao was sent back to garrison Hefei, and his rank was advanced to Marquis of Duxiang. He provided Liao's mother with a carriage and horses, and sent troops to escort Liao's family to the garrison, with instructions that when Liao's mother arrived, he should go out to welcome her with an escort. All the military officers and officials under Liao's command knelt along the road in homage, and observers considered it a great honor.",
  "When Emperor Wen ascended the throne, he enfeoffed Liao as Marquis of Jinyang and increased his territory by a thousand households, making a total of 2,600 households. In the second year of Huangchu (221 CE), Liao went to court at Luoyang Palace. Emperor Wen received Liao at Jianshi Hall and personally asked about his plans for defeating Wu. The Emperor sighed and said to those around him, \"This is like the ancient example of summoning a tiger.\" He had residences built for Liao and specially constructed a hall for Liao's mother. The infantry who had volunteered to follow Liao in defeating the Wu army were all made Tiger Warriors.",
  "When Sun Quan again declared allegiance, Liao returned to garrison Yongqiu but fell ill. The Emperor sent Palace Attendant Liu Ye with imperial physicians to tend to his illness, and Tiger Warriors inquired about his condition all along the road. Before he recovered, the Emperor invited him to the imperial residence. The imperial carriage personally arrived, the Emperor held his hand, bestowed imperial garments upon him, and the Imperial Kitchen sent imperial food daily. When his illness slightly improved, he returned to his garrison.",
  "When Sun Quan rebelled again, the Emperor sent Liao by boat with Cao Xiu to Hailing, overlooking the river. Sun Quan greatly feared them and instructed his generals: \"Although Zhang Liao is ill, he is still formidable—be careful!\" That year, Liao and the various generals defeated Sun Quan's general Lü Fan. Liao's illness worsened, and he died at Jiangdu. The Emperor wept for him and posthumously titled him Marquis Gang (\"Unyielding\"). His son Hu succeeded to his title.",
  "In the sixth year, the Emperor recalled Liao and Dian's achievements at Hefei and decreed: \"At the Battle of Hefei, Liao and Dian, with eight hundred infantry, defeated 100,000 rebels—unprecedented in military history. They have made the rebels lose their spirit even to this day—truly they can be called the talons and teeth of the state. Therefore, grant each of Liao and Dian's territories an additional hundred households, and bestow upon one son of each the rank of Marquis within the Passes.\" Hu became a Lieutenant General and later died. His son Tong succeeded to the title.",
  "Yue Jin",
  "Yue Jin, courtesy name Wenqian, was a native of Weigguo in Yangping. Small in stature, he followed Cao Cao for his courage and fierceness, serving as a clerk in his command. He was sent back to his home commandery to recruit soldiers, gathering over a thousand men, and upon his return was appointed as Acting Military Judicial Officer and Colonel Who Breaks the Enemy's Battle Lines. He accompanied Cao Cao in campaigns against Lü Bu at Puyang, Zhang Chao at Yongqiu, and Qiao Rui at Ku. In all cases, he was the first to scale the enemy's fortifications and achieved merit, for which he was enfeoffed as Marquis of Guangchang Ting.",
  "He followed Cao Cao in attacking Zhang Xiu at Anzhong, besieging Lü Bu at Xiapi, defeating separate enemy commanders, attacking Sui Gu at Sheqiu, and assaulting Liu Bei at Pei. In all these campaigns, the enemy was defeated, and Jin was appointed Colonel Who Punishes Bandits. He crossed the Yellow River to attack and capture Jiaye, and upon his return, joined the attack on Yuan Shao at Guandu, where he fought valiantly and beheaded Shao's general Chunyu Qiong. He joined the attack on Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at Liyang, killing their great general Yan Jing, and was made Acting General of Mobile Forces. He was sent separately to attack Yellow Turban forces, defeated them, and pacified Le'an Commandery. He participated in the siege of Ye, and after Ye was taken, he joined the attack on Yuan Tan at Nanpi, being the first to climb over the defenses and enter through Tan's eastern gate. After Tan was defeated, Jin separately attacked Yongnu and defeated them.",
  "In the 11th year of Jian'an (206 CE), Cao Cao sent a memorial to Emperor Xian recommending Jin along with Yu Jin and Zhang Liao, saying: \"Their martial prowess is vast, their strategic thinking is comprehensive, their loyalty is pure and focused, and they uphold integrity and righteousness. Whenever they face battle or siege, they always lead the charge, advancing boldly against fortified positions. There is no stronghold they cannot breach, and even while beating the drums themselves, their hands never tire. When sent on separate campaigns commanding troops, they harmonize their forces and follow orders without transgressions. When facing the enemy and making decisions, they never fail. In recognizing merit and recording service, each should receive illustrious favor.\" Therefore, Yu Jin was made General of Tiger's Might, Jin became General who Breaks the Enemy's Battle Lines, and Liao was appointed General who Quells Bandits.",
  "Jin was sent separately to attack Gao Gan, entering Shangdang from the north road and circling to appear behind him. Gan and his allies retreated to defend Hukuan, where successive battles led to many enemy casualties. Gan held firm in his defense and could not be overcome until Cao Cao personally came to campaign against him, at which point Jin's forces were able to take the position. When Cao Cao attacked Guan Cheng and camped at Chunyu, he sent Jin and Li Dian to attack him. Cheng was defeated and fled, escaping to an island in the sea. After the coastal regions were pacified but Jingzhou had not yet submitted, Jin was dispatched to garrison Yangdi. Later, he joined the pacification of Jingzhou and remained stationed at Xiangyang, where he attacked Guan Yu, Su Fei, and others, all of whom fled. Various mountain tribes from the commanderies of Nan Jun came to Jin to surrender. He also attacked Liu Bei's subordinates Du Pu, the chief of Linshu, and Liang Da, the chief of Jingyang, defeating them decisively.",
  "Later, he joined the campaign against Sun Quan and was granted the ceremonial axe. When Cao Cao returned, he left Jin along with Zhang Liao and Li Dian to garrison Hefei, increasing Jin's territory by five hundred households, making a total of one thousand two hundred households. Because Jin had achieved merit numerous times, five hundred households were set aside to enfeoff one of his sons as a marquis. Jin was promoted to General of the Right. In the 23rd year of Jian'an (218 CE), he passed away and was posthumously titled Marquis Wei. His son, Chen, succeeded to his title.",
  "Chen was resolute and courageous like his father and rose to the position of Inspector of Yangzhou. When Zhuge Dan rebelled, he launched a surprise attack and killed Chen. An imperial edict expressed grief and regret for his death, posthumously granted him the title of Commandant of Guards, and he was posthumously titled Marquis Min. His son, Zhao, succeeded to the title.",
  "Yu Jin",
  "Yu Jin, courtesy name Wenze, was a native of Juping in Taishan. When the Yellow Turbans arose, Bao Xin gathered followers, and Jin joined him. When Cao Cao took control of Yanzhou, Jin and his associates came to serve as regional commanders under General Wang Lang. Lang recognized his exceptional abilities and recommended Jin as someone capable of being a Grand General. Cao Cao summoned Jin for a conversation, then appointed him as Military Advisor and sent him with troops to Xuzhou to attack Guangwei, which he captured. Jin was then appointed as Colonel Who Breaks Battle Formations.",
  "He joined the attack against Lü Bu at Puyang, separately defeating two of Bu's camps south of the city, and also led a separate force to defeat Gao Ya at Xuchang. He participated in attacks on Shouzhang, Dingtao, and Lihu, and besieged Zhang Chao at Yongqiu, capturing all these places. When he joined the campaign against Yellow Turban leaders Liu Pi and Huang Shao, who were stationed at Banliang, Shao and his associates launched a night raid on Cao Cao's camp. Jin led his subordinates to defeat them, beheading Pi, Shao, and others, and accepting the surrender of all their followers. He was promoted to Colonel Who Pacifies the Barbarians.",
  "He participated in surrounding Qiao Rui at Ku, beheading Rui and four other commanders. He accompanied Cao Cao to Wan, where Zhang Xiu surrendered. When Xiu later rebelled, Cao Cao engaged him in battle but was defeated and retreated to Wu'yin. At that time, the army was in disarray, with soldiers scattered and searching for Cao Cao. Jin alone kept several hundred of his men in formation, fighting while withdrawing, and though they suffered casualties, they remained together. As the enemy pursuit slackened, Jin gradually reorganized his troops, beat the drums, and returned. Before reaching Cao Cao's position, on the road he saw more than ten wounded men fleeing naked. Jin asked them what had happened, and they said: 'We were robbed by the Qingzhou troops.' Initially, these were Yellow Turban soldiers who had surrendered and were called the Qingzhou troops. Cao Cao had treated them leniently, which emboldened them to commit robberies. Jin became angry and ordered his men: 'The Qingzhou troops are all under Lord Cao's command, yet they turn to banditry!' He pursued them and recounted their crimes. The Qingzhou troops quickly fled to Cao Cao to lodge a complaint against Jin.",
  "When Jin arrived, he first established a camp and did not immediately report to Cao Cao. Someone said to Jin: 'The Qingzhou troops have already complained about you. You should quickly go to Lord Cao to explain.' Jin replied: 'The enemy is behind us and may arrive at any moment. If we don't first prepare defenses, how can we meet them? Besides, Lord Cao is perceptive—what need is there to worry about slander?' After leisurely digging trenches and securing the camp, he went to report to Cao Cao, fully explaining what had happened. Cao Cao was pleased and said to Jin: 'In the disaster at Yu River, when I was in dire straits, you maintained order amidst chaos, punished the violent, and established strong defenses. You have an unshakable character that even the famous generals of old could not surpass!' Cao Cao then recorded Jin's previous achievements and enfeoffed him as Marquis of Yishou Ting. Jin later joined the attack on Zhang Xiu at Rang, the capture of Lü Bu at Xiapi, and separately collaborated with Shi Huan and Cao Ren to attack Sui Gu at Sheqiu, defeating and beheading him.",
  "When Cao Cao first campaigned against Yuan Shao, Shao's forces were numerous. Jin volunteered to lead the vanguard, and Cao Cao, impressed by his courage, sent him with two thousand infantry to defend Yanjin against Shao while Cao Cao led the main army back to Guandu. When Liu Bei rebelled in Xuzhou, Cao Cao marched east against him. Yuan Shao attacked Jin, but Jin held firm, and Shao could not overcome him. Jin later collaborated with Yue Jin and others, leading five thousand infantry and cavalry to attack one of Shao's separate camps. Following the southwest bank of the Yellow River from Yanjin to Ji and Huojia counties, they burned more than thirty enemy settlements, killing and capturing thousands, and accepting the surrender of more than twenty of Shao's commanders, including He Mao and Wang Mo. Cao Cao then sent Jin to garrison Yuanwu, where he attacked and defeated another of Yuan Shao's camps at Dushi Ferry. Jin was promoted to Lieutenant General and later accompanied Cao Cao back to Guandu.",
  "When Cao Cao and Yuan Shao had opposing camps, they built earthen mounds facing each other. Shao's archers shot into Cao Cao's camp, killing and wounding many soldiers, causing fear in the army. Jin supervised the defense of the earthen mound, fought vigorously, and his spirit grew even more resolute. After Shao was defeated, Jin was promoted to General. After Jizhou was pacified, Chang Xi rebelled again, and Jin was sent to campaign against him. Jin advanced quickly to attack Xi. Since Xi and Jin were old friends, Xi came to surrender to Jin. All the other generals believed that since Xi had surrendered, he should be sent to Cao Cao. Jin said: 'Do you gentlemen not know the lord's standing order? Those who surrender only after being besieged are not pardoned. To uphold the law and execute orders is the principle of serving one's superior. Though Xi is an old friend, how can Jin abandon principle?' Jin personally presided over Xi's execution, shedding tears as he beheaded him. At that time, Cao Cao was camped at Chunyu and heard of this, sighing: 'Xi surrendered not to me but to Jin—was this not fate?' He valued Jin even more highly.",
  "[Pei Songzhi's commentary: I believe that although the law does not pardon those who surrender only after being besieged, imprisoning Xi and sending him to Cao Cao would not have violated orders. Jin did not try to seek any chance of mercy for an old friend but instead indulged his fondness for execution, going against public opinion. This is why he eventually became a surrendered captive himself and was given a posthumous title indicating wickedness—deservedly so.]",
  "After the pacification of Donghai, Jin was appointed as General of Tiger's Might. Later, he joined Zang Ba and others in attacking Mei Cheng, while Zhang Liao and Zhang He campaigned against Chen Lan. When Jin arrived, Cheng surrendered with over three thousand followers. After surrendering, Cheng rebelled again, and his followers fled to join Lan. Liao and his forces were engaged in a standoff with Lan, and their supplies were running low. Jin transported provisions in continuous supply, enabling Liao to eventually behead both Lan and Cheng. Jin's territory was increased by two hundred households, making a total of one thousand two hundred households.",
  "At this time, Jin along with Zhang Liao, Yue Jin, Zhang He, and Xu Huang were all regarded as famous generals. Whenever Cao Cao went on campaign, they would take turns serving as the vanguard and rearguard. Jin maintained strict discipline in his army, and when he acquired enemy wealth and goods, he never kept any for himself, which earned him especially generous rewards. However, he ruled his subordinates strictly by law and was not particularly popular among the troops. Cao Cao once held a grudge against Zhu Ling and wanted to take away his command. Knowing that Jin had an imposing authority, Cao Cao sent Jin with several dozen horsemen, carrying written orders, directly to Ling's camp to take over his forces. Neither Ling nor his subordinates dared to resist. Jin then made Ling a commander under his authority. Everyone was in awe of Jin, showing how much he was feared. He was promoted to General of the Left, granted the ceremonial axe, had his marquisate increased by five hundred households, and one of his sons was enfeoffed as a marquis.",
  "In the 24th year of Jian'an (219 CE), when Cao Cao was in Chang'an, he sent Cao Ren to campaign against Guan Yu at Fan, and also dispatched Jin to assist Ren. In autumn, there were heavy rains, the Han River flooded, and the water was several zhang deep on flat ground, submerging all seven of Jin's army units. Jin and his commanders climbed to high ground to observe the water, with nowhere to retreat. Yu, riding large ships, attacked Jin and his forces, and Jin surrendered. Only Pang De refused to submit and died. When Cao Cao heard this, he sighed deeply for a long while and said: 'I have known Jin for thirty years. How could I have imagined that in facing danger and difficulty, he would not match Pang De!' Later, when Sun Quan captured Guan Yu and his forces, Jin was among those in Wu. When Emperor Wen (Cao Pi) ascended the throne, Sun Quan pledged allegiance and sent Jin back. The Emperor granted Jin an audience; his hair and beard had turned completely white, and he appeared emaciated as he prostrated himself with tears.",
  "The Emperor consoled him by citing the historical examples of Xun Linfu and Meng Mingshi. [According to the 'Book of Wei,' the imperial decree stated: 'In the past, Xun Linfu was defeated at Pi, and Meng Mingshi lost his army at Yao, yet Jin and Qin did not remove them from office but restored their positions. Subsequently, Jin acquired Di territory, and Qin dominated the western Rong. Even small states could be so magnanimous—how much more so for a great power with ten thousand chariots? The defeat at Fan was due to a sudden flood disaster, not a military failure. Therefore, restore Jin and others to their offices.'] Jin was appointed as General Who Pacifies the Distance.",
  "The Emperor wanted to send an envoy to Wu but first ordered Jin to go north to Ye to pay respects at the imperial tomb. The Emperor had already arranged for the tomb chamber to be painted with scenes depicting Guan Yu's victory in battle, Pang De's indignant resistance, and Jin's surrender. When Jin saw this, he was so humiliated and angered that he fell ill and died. His son, Gui, succeeded to his title as Marquis of Yishou Ting. Jin was posthumously titled Marquis Li (\"Harsh\").",
  "Zhang He",
    "Zhang He, courtesy name Junyi, was a native of Tang in Hejian. At the end of the Han dynasty, he answered a call to fight the Yellow Turbans and became a Military Advisor under Han Fu. After Fu was defeated, He brought his troops to serve Yuan Shao. Shao appointed He as Colonel and sent him to resist Gongsun Zan. After Zan was defeated, He had achieved numerous merits and was promoted to Central Gentleman of Ningguo.",
    "[According to the 'Spring and Autumn Annals of Han and Jin': 'He advised Shao, saying: \"Though you have won successive victories, you should not engage Cao Cao in battle. Instead, secretly send light cavalry to cut off his southern supply lines, and his forces will naturally be defeated.\" Shao did not follow his advice.']",
    "When Cao Cao and Yuan Shao faced each other at Guandu, Shao sent commanders Chunyu Qiong and others to supervise the transport of supplies and camp at Wuchao. Cao Cao personally led a swift attack against them. He advised Shao: 'Cao Cao's troops are elite. If he goes, he will certainly defeat Qiong and the others. If Qiong and his forces are defeated, then your lordship's cause will be lost. You should quickly lead troops to save them.' Guo Tu said: 'He's plan is wrong. We should instead attack his main camp. This will force him to return, which would be the same as relieving our forces without directly rescuing them.' He responded: 'Cao Cao's camp is well-fortified, and attacking it will certainly not succeed. If Qiong and the others are captured, we will all become prisoners.' Shao only sent light cavalry to rescue Qiong while using his main force to attack Cao Cao's camp, but they could not overcome it. Cao Cao did indeed defeat Qiong and the others, and Shao's army collapsed. Tu was ashamed and further slandered He, saying: 'He is pleased about our army's defeat and has spoken disrespectfully.' Fearful, He went over to Cao Cao.",
    "[Pei Songzhi's commentary: According to the Records of Wei and the Biography of Yuan Shao, Yuan Shao sent Zhang He and Gao Lan to attack Cao Cao's camp. After He and the others heard that Chunyu Qiong had been defeated, they came to surrender, and Shao's forces then completely collapsed. This suggests that Shao's army fell apart after He and the others surrendered. However, this biography states that Shao's army first collapsed, and He, fearing Guo Tu's slander, then went over to Cao Cao, which is inconsistent with the other accounts.]",
    "Cao Cao was delighted to have He and said to him: 'Wu Zixu failed to awaken in time, bringing danger upon himself. How much better to be like Weizi who left the Shang dynasty, or Han Xin who joined the Han!' He was appointed General and enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting. He was given command of troops and joined the attack on Ye, which they captured. He also joined the attack on Yuan Tan in Bohai, and separately led troops to besiege Yongnu, inflicting a major defeat. He joined the campaign against Liucheng, and alongside Zhang Liao served as the vanguard. For his achievements, he was promoted to General Who Subdues the Di People.",
    "He was sent separately to campaign in Donglai and to attack Guan Cheng, and again collaborated with Zhang Liao in defeating Chen Lan, Mei Cheng, and others. He joined in defeating Ma Chao and Han Sui south of the Wei River. He besieged Anding and forced Yang Qiu to surrender. With Xiahou Yuan, he campaigned against the bandits of Fu led by Liang Xing and the Di people of Wudu. He also defeated Ma Chao and pacified Song Jian. When Cao Cao campaigned against Zhang Lu, he first sent He to lead various armies against the Xinghuo Di king Dou Mao. Cao Cao entered Hanzhong from the Sanguan Pass and again sent He ahead with five thousand infantry to clear the roads. When they reached Yangping, Lu surrendered. After Cao Cao returned, he left He with Xiahou Yuan and others to guard Hanzhong and resist Liu Bei. He separately led various armies to subdue the two commanderies of Badong and Baxi, relocating their populations to Hanzhong.",
    "He advanced his army to Dangqu but was blocked by Bei's general Zhang Fei and withdrew to Nanzheng. He was appointed General Who Quells Bandits. Liu Bei stationed troops at Yangping, while He camped at Guangshi. Bei divided over ten thousand elite troops into ten groups and launched a night attack on He. He led his personal troops in fierce combat, and Bei could not prevail. Later, Bei burned the surrounding area in Zoumagu, and Yuan went to fight the fire. Taking a different route, Yuan encountered Bei, and they fought in close combat. Yuan was killed, and He returned to Yangping.",
    "[According to the 'Wei Lüe': 'Although Yuan was the overall commander, Liu Bei feared He but took Yuan lightly. After killing Yuan, Bei said: \"I should have captured their leader; what use is this?\"']",
    "At this moment, having just lost their commander, they feared Bei would take advantage of the situation, and the three armies were panicked. Yuan's Marshal Guo Huai then told the troops: 'General Zhang is a famous general of the state and someone Liu Bei fears. Today's emergency cannot be stabilized without General Zhang.' They then pushed He forward as the army's leader. He came out, organized the troops and established formations. All the generals received He's orders, and the army's morale was stabilized. Cao Cao, who was in Chang'an, sent an envoy to grant He the ceremonial axe. Cao Cao then personally came to Hanzhong, and Liu Bei took refuge in the high mountains, not daring to fight. Cao Cao withdrew all armies from Hanzhong, and He returned to garrison Chencang.",
    "When Emperor Wen (Cao Pi) became King, he appointed He as General of the Left and promoted his rank to Marquis of Dongxiang. After ascending the throne, he further promoted He to Marquis of Tang. He decreed that He and Cao Zhen should campaign against the Lu River Hu of Anding and the Eastern Qiang. He summoned He and Zhen to court at the Xu Palace, then sent them south to attack Jiangling with Xiahou Shang. He separately led various armies across the river and captured strongholds on the islands. When Emperor Ming (Cao Rui) ascended the throne, he sent He south to garrison Jingzhou. With Sima Yi, he attacked Sun Quan's general Liu A and others, pursuing them to Qikou, where they engaged in battle and defeated them.",
    "When Zhuge Liang emerged from the Qishan mountains, He was promoted to the rank of Special Advanced and sent to lead various armies to resist Liang's general Ma Su at Jieting. Su relied on the southern mountains and did not defend the city. He cut off their water supply, attacked, and inflicted a major defeat. The commanderies of Nan'an, Tianshui, and Anding had rebelled in response to Liang, and He pacified all of them. The imperial decree stated: 'Bandit Liang, using the forces of Ba and Shu, confronted our tiger-like army. General, you donned armor and wielded weapons, achieving victory wherever you turned. I greatly commend this. Your territory is increased by one thousand households, for a total of four thousand three hundred households.'",
    "When Sima Yi was developing naval forces in Jingzhou, intending to follow the Mian River into the Yangtze to attack Wu, an imperial decree ordered He to lead the armies of Guanzhong to receive Sima Yi's commands. He reached Jingzhou, but because the winter waters were shallow and large ships could not proceed, he withdrew to garrison Fangcheng. When Zhuge Liang emerged again and urgently attacked Chencang, the Emperor sent a fast messenger to summon He to the capital. The Emperor personally went to the Henan fortress, held a banquet to see He off, and dispatched thirty thousand troops from the Northern and Southern Armies, along with detachments from the Imperial Guard and Tiger Warriors to protect He. The Emperor asked He: 'By the time the general arrives, won't Liang have already taken Chencang?' He knew that Liang's suspended army lacked provisions and couldn't maintain a long siege, so he replied: 'By the time I arrive, Liang will already have retreated. I reckon his provisions won't last ten days.' He advanced day and night to Nanzheng, and Liang indeed withdrew. An imperial decree summoned He back to the capital, and he was appointed General of the Chariots Who Conquers the West.",
    "He was skilled at identifying changing circumstances, adept at establishing camps and formations, and evaluating battle situations and terrain. His plans invariably succeeded, and even Zhuge Liang feared him. Although He was a military man, he loved and valued scholars. He once recommended his fellow countryman Bei Zhan, who was learned and of good conduct. The Emperor's decree stated: 'In the past, Ji Zun as a general established the position of Grand Master of the Five Classics, who resided in the military camp and engaged in elegant songs and arrow-tossing games with other scholars. Now, General, you externally command martial forces while internally honoring the court. I appreciate the general's intention and have now elevated Zhan to the position of Erudite.'",
    "When Zhuge Liang again emerged from the Qishan mountains, an imperial decree ordered He to lead various generals west to Lueyang. Liang returned to take refuge at Qishan, and He pursued him to Mumen. Engaging Liang's troops in battle, He was hit in the right knee by a flying arrow and died.",
    "[According to the 'Wei Lüe': 'Liang's army was retreating, and Sima Yi ordered He to pursue them. He said: \"According to military law, when besieging a city, one must leave an escape route, and one should not pursue a retreating army.\" Sima Yi would not listen. He had no choice but to advance. The Shu army took advantage of the high ground to set ambushes, and crossbow bolts were fired in volleys, with an arrow striking He in the thigh.']",
    "He was posthumously titled Marquis Zhang. His son Xiong succeeded him. For He's previous military achievements, Emperor Ming divided his households and enfeoffed four of He's sons as marquises. His youngest son was granted the rank of Marquis within the Passes.",
  "Xu Huang",
  "Xu Huang, courtesy name Gongming, was from Yang County in Hedong. He served as a county official and followed Cavalry General Yang Feng in fighting rebels, achieving merit and being appointed as Cavalry Commandant. During the chaos caused by Li Jue and Guo Si in Chang'an, Huang advised Feng to escort the Emperor back to Luoyang, and Feng followed his suggestion. When the Emperor crossed the Yellow River and reached Anyi, Huang was enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting. Upon reaching Luoyang, as Han Xian and Dong Cheng fought daily, Huang advised Feng to submit to Cao Cao. Feng initially agreed but later changed his mind. When Cao Cao attacked Feng at Liang, Huang then went over to Cao Cao.",
  "Cao Cao gave Huang command of troops and had him attack the bandits of Juan and Yuanwu, defeating them. Huang was appointed Lieutenant General. He joined the campaign against Lü Bu and separately accepted the surrender of Bu's generals Zhao Shu and Li Zou. With Shi Huan, he beheaded Sui Gu in Henei. He participated in defeating Liu Bei and in defeating Yan Liang, capturing Baima, advancing to Yanjin, and defeating Wen Chou. He was appointed General. With Cao Hong, he attacked the Bing River bandits led by Zhu Bi, defeating them. Again with Shi Huan, he attacked Yuan Shao's supply convoy at Gushi and achieved the greatest merit, being enfeoffed as Marquis of Duting.",
  "After Cao Cao had besieged Ye and conquered Handan, Han Fan, the Prefect of Yiyang, pretended to surrender the city but then defended it. Cao Cao sent Huang to attack it. When Huang arrived, he shot arrows with messages into the city, explaining the consequences of resistance. Fan regretted his decision, and Huang immediately accepted his surrender. Afterward, Huang said to Cao Cao: 'While the two Yuans are not yet defeated and various cities have not yet submitted, they are all waiting to see what happens. If we destroy Yiyang today, then tomorrow they will all defend to the death. I fear there will be no end to the fighting in the north. I suggest that my lord pardon Yiyang to demonstrate to the other cities, and then none will resist.' Cao Cao agreed with this approach.",
  "Huang separately attacked Maocheng, set up an ambush, and defeated three enemy camps. He joined in defeating Yuan Tan at Nanpi and suppressed rebels in Pingyuan, conquering them. He participated in the campaign against Dadun and was appointed General of the Open Fields. He joined the expedition against Jingzhou, separately garrisoning Fan, and suppressed bandits in Zhonglu, Linshui, and Yicheng. He joined Man Chong in opposing Guan Yu at Hanjin and fought with Cao Ren against Zhou Yu at Jiangling. In the 15th year of Jian'an (210 CE), he campaigned against rebels in Taiyuan, besieged Daling, and captured it, beheading the rebel leader Shang Yao.",
  "When Han Sui, Ma Chao, and others revolted in the northwest, Huang was sent to garrison Fenyin to stabilize Hedong. Cao Cao bestowed cattle and wine on him, instructing him to make offerings at his ancestors' graves. When Cao Cao reached Tongguan Pass and feared he would be unable to cross, he summoned Huang for advice. Huang said: 'You have concentrated your forces here, yet the enemy is not separately defending Puban Ford. This shows their lack of strategy. Now, if you grant me elite troops to cross at Puban Ford and establish a foothold to cut off their rear, the enemy can be captured.' Cao Cao said: 'Excellent.' He sent Huang with four thousand infantry and cavalry to cross the ford.",
  "Before they could complete their trenches and palisades, the rebel Liang Xing led over five thousand infantry and cavalry to attack Huang at night. Huang defeated them, and Cao Cao's army was then able to cross. They subsequently defeated Ma Chao and his allies. Cao Cao sent Huang along with Xiahou Yuan to pacify the Yi and Mi region and the various Di tribes, then joining Cao Cao at Anding. After Cao Cao returned to Ye, he had Huang and Xiahou Yuan pacify the remaining bandits in Fu and Xiayang, beheading Liang Xing and accepting the surrender of over three thousand households. Huang joined the campaign against Zhang Lu and was separately dispatched to attack and subdue the mountain Di tribes of Du and Qiuyi, all of whom surrendered. He was promoted to General Who Pacifies the Enemy.",
  "He relieved the siege of General Zhang Shun. He attacked the bandit Chen Fu and others in more than thirty camps, defeating them all. When Cao Cao returned to Ye, he left Huang and Xiahou Yuan to resist Liu Bei at Yangping. Bei sent Chen Shi and others to establish more than ten camps to cut off the road at Mamingge. Huang separately campaigned against and defeated them. The enemy troops threw themselves into valleys, and many died. When Cao Cao heard of this, he was greatly pleased and granted Huang the ceremonial axe, saying in his order: 'This mountain pass is the critical throat that controls access to Hanzhong. Liu Bei wanted to cut off communication between the interior and exterior, and thereby take Hanzhong. With one strike, General, you have thwarted the enemy's plan—this is the best of the best.'",
  "Cao Cao then personally came to Yangping and withdrew all armies from Hanzhong. He again sent Huang to assist Cao Ren in attacking Guan Yu, and Huang was stationed at Wan. The Han River suddenly rose, and Yu Jin and his forces were submerged. Yu besieged Ren at Fan and also surrounded General Lü Chang at Xiangyang. Most of Huang's troops were new recruits, and considering Yu a difficult opponent to face directly, he advanced to camp at Yangling Slope. Cao Cao had returned and sent Generals Xu Shang, Lü Jian, and others to join Huang, with orders stating: 'Wait until the troops and horses have gathered in sufficient numbers before advancing together.'",
  "The enemy was camped at Yancheng. When Huang arrived, he deceptively constructed a large trench to make it appear as if he intended to cut off their rear. The enemy, seeing this, burned their camp and fled. Huang captured Yancheng and established a camp with defenses on two sides, gradually moving forward until he was within thirty paces of the enemy's siege works. Without launching an attack, Cao Cao sent Yin Shu, Zhu Gai, and others—a total of twelve camps—to join Huang. The enemy had a camp at the head of their siege lines and four camps on separate mounds.",
  "Huang announced that he would attack the camp at the head of the siege, but secretly attacked the four camps on the mounds. When Guan Yu saw that the four camps were about to fall, he personally led five thousand infantry and cavalry to engage. Huang attacked him, forcing him to retreat. Huang pursued Yu, broke through the siege lines, and entered the encirclement, defeating Yu's forces. Some of the enemy threw themselves into the Mian River and drowned. Cao Cao's order stated: 'The enemy's siege trenches and wooden stockades were ten layers deep. General, you fought to complete victory, breaking through the enemy's siege works and beheading or capturing many of them. In my thirty years of military campaigns, and from what I have heard of the skillful commanders of ancient times, none has ever directly charged into an enemy's siege works. Moreover, Fan and Xiangyang under siege were in a situation worse than Ju and Jimo, and your achievement, General, surpasses those of Sun Wu and Tian Rangju.'",
  "Huang led his army back to Mopi, where Cao Cao went seven li to welcome him and held a great banquet. Raising a cup of wine to toast Huang, Cao Cao congratulated him, saying: 'The preservation of Fan and Xiangyang is due to your achievement, General.' At that time, all the armies had gathered, and Cao Cao inspected the various camps. The soldiers all left their formations to watch, but in Huang's camp, everything remained orderly, with officers and men maintaining their positions without moving. Cao Cao sighed: 'General Xu can truly be said to possess the style of Zhou Yafu!'",
  "When Emperor Wen (Cao Pi) took the position of King, he appointed Huang as General of the Right and promoted his rank to Marquis of Lu Township. After ascending the throne, Cao Pi further promoted him to Marquis of Yang. With Xiahou Shang, he attacked Liu Bei at Shangyong and defeated him. Huang was stationed to guard Yangping and was later transferred and enfeoffed as Marquis of Yangping. When Emperor Ming (Cao Rui) ascended the throne, Huang resisted Wu general Zhuge Jin at Xiangyang. His territory was increased by two hundred households, bringing his total to three thousand one hundred households. When he fell gravely ill, he left instructions to be buried in his everyday clothes.",
  "By nature, he was frugal, cautious, and respectful. As a general, he kept his scouts far afield and always prepared for a position of strength before engaging in battle. When pursuing a fleeing enemy or competing for advantage, his soldiers had no time to eat. He often sighed: 'The ancients worried about not meeting an enlightened lord. Now, fortunately having met one, I constantly strive to prove myself through achievements. What use is there in seeking private praise!' He never sought to expand his connections. In the first year of Taihe (227 CE), he passed away and was posthumously titled Marquis Zhuang (\"Robust\"). His son Gai succeeded him. After Gai's death, his son Ba succeeded to the title. Emperor Ming divided Huang's households and enfeoffed two of Huang's grandsons as marquises.",
  "Zhu Ling",
  "Initially, Zhu Ling from Qinghe served as a general under Yuan Shao. When Cao Cao campaigned against Tao Qian, Shao sent Ling to lead three divisions to assist Cao Cao, and Ling achieved military merit. When the other generals sent by Shao each returned home, Ling said: 'I have observed many men, but none compare to Lord Cao—he is truly a brilliant ruler. Having already met him, where else would I go?' Thus he remained and did not leave. The soldiers he commanded admired him and all stayed with him. Ling later became an excellent general, his reputation second only to Xu Huang and others. He rose to the position of Rear General and was enfeoffed as Marquis of Gaotang Ting.",
  "[According to the 'Nine Provinces Chronicle': 'Initially, when Ji Yong of Qinghe rebelled against Yuan Shao and surrendered to Gongsun Zan, Zan sent troops to protect him. Shao sent Ling to attack him. Ling's family was inside the city, and Zan's general placed Ling's mother and younger brother on the city wall, calling out to entice Ling. Ling looked toward the city, weeping, and said: \"As a man who has pledged his service to another, how can I still worry about my family?\" He fought fiercely and captured the city, taking Yong alive, but his family members were all killed.']",
  "[According to the 'Book of Wei': 'Ling's courtesy name was Wenbo. After Cao Cao had pacified Jizhou, he sent Ling to lead five thousand new recruits and one thousand horses to guard the south of Xu. Cao Cao cautioned him: \"The new troops from Jizhou have been accustomed to leniency, and though they now appear well-organized, they are still discontent. You have a reputation for strictness—use your methods to pacify them. Otherwise, there will be trouble.\" Upon reaching Yangdi, the Palace Attendant Cheng Ang and others rebelled. Ling immediately beheaded Ang and reported this to Cao Cao. Cao Cao wrote back: \"The danger in military affairs comes from facing enemy states externally while dealing with unpredictable treasonous plots internally. In the past, when Deng Yu divided General Guangwu's army and went west, he faced the difficulties of Zong Xin and Feng Yin, but later returned to Luoyang with only twenty-four riders. Was Yu diminished by this? Your letter expresses remorse and repeatedly attributes blame to yourself, but it may not be as you say.\" When Emperor Wen (Cao Pi) ascended the throne, he enfeoffed Ling as Marquis of Meng and increased his households and territory. An imperial decree stated: \"General, you assisted my late father in establishing his mandate, commanded troops for many years, with authority surpassing Fang Shao and achievements exceeding Jiang and Guan. The records and writings that commend you—what more could be added? I have received Heaven's Mandate and rule the empire. The generals of fundamental merit and ministers of the state are all those with whom I share prosperity and good fortune, to be passed down without end. Now you are enfeoffed as Marquis of Meng. Wealth and nobility that do not return to one's homeland are like wearing embroidered clothes while walking at night. If you have ordinary wishes, please do not hesitate to speak.\" Ling replied: \"Gaotang is what I have long desired.\" So he was instead enfeoffed as Marquis of Gaotang. When he died, he was posthumously titled Marquis Wei (\"Mighty\").']",
  "Author's Assessment",
  "The author comments: Cao Cao established these military achievements, and among the outstanding generals of his time, these five men were foremost. Yu Jin was most renowned for his steadiness and gravity, though he did not complete his final years with honor. Zhang He was known for his ingenious adaptability. Yue Jin gained fame for his fierce valor. Yet when examining their deeds, these men did not fully live up to their reputations. Perhaps the historical records have omissions, as they are not as thoroughly detailed as the accounts of Zhang Liao and Xu Huang.",

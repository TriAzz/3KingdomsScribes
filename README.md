# Three Kingdoms History Website

*This project was created in large part using GitHub Copilot and Windsurf as part of the Deakin InnovAIte initiative investigating AI tools.*

A modern, accessible website for reading and understanding the biographies and annals from the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" (三國志) with clear English translations and historical context.

Live site: https://3kingdomsscribed.netlify.app/

## Project Overview
This project presents the fasticles (sections) from the Books of Wei, Shu, and Wu, allowing users to:

- Browse fasticle lists for each kingdom
- View main figures in each fasticle
- Navigate via breadcrumbs with fasticle names
- Read modern, accessible English translations (in progress)

## Features
- Consistent Navigation: Fasticle lists for Wei, Shu, and Wu, each with ID, name, and main people.
- Dynamic Routing: Detail pages for every fasticle in all three books, showing main people (record text in progress).
- Breadcrumbs: Show book and fasticle names for easy navigation.
- Translation Focus: Translations are adapted for clarity, with added explanations for historical ranks and positions.
- No Horizontal Scrolling: Layout ensures a clean, scroll-free experience on all devices.
- AI Chatbot: Available for questions about the Three Kingdoms period (Note: Requires the local backend server to be running, which isn't always the case)
